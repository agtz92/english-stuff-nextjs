short-description: You've been reading for hours, and the only light in the room
  is from your phone. The moonlight casts a weird glow on everything; it feels
  like there's something lurking just out of sight. Your eyes want to close, but
  you need to finish this book. You're so engrossed that you don't notice the
  creaking of floorboards outside your door until a hand clamps tightly over
  your mouth.
