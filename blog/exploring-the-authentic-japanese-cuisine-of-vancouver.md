  Vancouver’s love affair with Japanese food doesn’t end with sushi; it also stretches into other areas like yakitori (grilled chicken skewers) and ramen. While these two dishes may not be as popular as sushi in North America, they remain staples throughout Japan and now they can easily be found here in Vancouver too! Popular storefronts like Jang Mo Jib serve up some of the most authentic Korean-Japanese dishes this side of Tokyo while establishments like Toratatsu specialize in lively yakitori experiences where guests can savor tender pieces of grilled meat while engaging in lighthearted banter with staff members.

  Tempura plays an important part in Tokyo culture so it stands to reason that it would feature prominently on Vancouver menus as well. Tempura is a traditional-style deep frying technique where ingredients are lightly battered before being submerged into hot oil — creating deliciously crunchy dishes that wouldn't normally be achievable when cooked at lower temperatures. In Vancouver, tempura specialists such as Kitsuneya have quickly become fan-favorites thanks to their detailed attention to preparation and presentation coupled with bold flavor profiles inspired by Kyoto-style recipes.

  It's impossible to talk about unique takes on Japanese cuisine without mentioning fusion restaurants; establishments like Kishimoto boast uniquely creative concoctions such as beef tartar topped tacos alongside more faithful interpretations of classic dishes like tonkatsu (breaded pork). Fusion eateries often draw inspiration from across Asia resulting in inventive menu items that combine unexpected ingredients yet somehow still feel unmistakably Japanese in spirit—definitely worth trying!
