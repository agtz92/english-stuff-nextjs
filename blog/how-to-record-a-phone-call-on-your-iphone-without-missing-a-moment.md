  ### The Easiest Way to Record a Phone Call on Your iPhone


  **With iOS 18, recording calls on your iPhone is finally native, simple, and automatic.**


  For years, iPhone users relied on clunky third-party apps or complicated workarounds just to record a phone call. Now, Apple has solved that problem by introducing native call recording in **iOS 18**—and it’s integrated directly into your calling interface.


  To record a phone call, just make a call as usual. Once the other person answers, a **call recording icon** (depicted as sound waves) will appear in the top-left corner of your screen. Tap it, and a pop-up will explain the feature the first time you use it. Tap **Continue**, and Apple will play a short audio message alerting both parties that the call is being recorded.


  Once the conversation ends—or if you manually tap the **Stop** button on the recording monitor—the recording stops automatically. From there, the magic happens behind the scenes: your audio recording and a full transcript are **saved in the Notes app**.


  You can play the recording directly from the note, save it for reference, or delete it completely. No extra apps, subscriptions, or third-party storage services needed. It’s all done within your iPhone’s native system.

  ### Recording Notifications: What Everyone on the Call Will Hear


  **Apple builds transparency into the process, so everyone knows when they’re being recorded.**


  In many places, it's illegal to record a conversation without informing the other party—and Apple has baked this principle right into the system. When you start recording a call, your iPhone plays a brief but audible message to notify everyone that the call is being recorded.


  This isn't just a feature—it’s a safeguard. Whether you're calling a client, a friend, or a colleague, this default announcement helps ensure that your call recording is compliant with **two-party consent laws** in regions that require it.


  There’s no way to turn this alert off. It’s part of Apple’s approach to privacy and user protection. So, if you plan to record a call, make sure you do so ethically and legally by keeping all participants in the loop.


  If you're in a one-party consent state or country, you may not legally need permission, but that doesn't override the automatic alert your iPhone will issue. Use this as a reminder that **transparency and consent** are always best practices when recording communications.

  ### Where Recordings Are Stored and How to Access Them


  **Your call recordings are saved automatically in Notes—complete with searchable transcripts.**


  One of the most powerful features of iOS 18’s new call recording function is its seamless integration with the **Notes app**. After a call ends, your iPhone creates a new note containing both the **audio recording** and an **AI-generated transcript**.


  This makes reviewing, organizing, and sharing important phone calls incredibly easy. Whether you’re documenting interviews, business calls, or even funny conversations with friends, you can find, play, and share them right from Notes.


  Each recording note is timestamped, labeled, and organized like any other note. You can rename the note, add it to a folder, or tag it for easier retrieval. And thanks to Apple’s on-device intelligence, your transcripts are searchable—so you can quickly locate specific conversations by keyword.


  Want to remove a recording? Just delete the note. That action removes both the audio and transcript. It’s privacy-first, giving you complete control over what’s kept and what’s erased.

  ### What If Someone Is Recording *You*?


  **You can’t block recording on their end, but Apple gives you a warning and a choice.**


  Apple’s system works both ways. If someone calls you and begins recording, your iPhone will automatically **play the same audio alert** letting you know the conversation is being recorded. This feature ensures that you're never unknowingly recorded during a call.


  Currently, iPhones don’t offer a setting to prevent someone else from recording a call. If you're uncomfortable with being recorded, your only recourse is to ask the other person to stop—or hang up the call altogether.


  This built-in notice acts as a fair and ethical middle ground, giving both parties the opportunity to consent—or opt out. As Apple continues to push for user privacy and security, this feature offers peace of mind that you won’t be recorded in secret on iOS devices.


  If you hear the recording alert and don't want your words on the record, be direct: ask to disable recording, or politely end the call. Apple has put the power back in your hands, even when you’re not the one pressing record.

  ### iOS 18 Requirements and Setup Tips


  **Only iPhones running iOS 18 or higher can access call recording—make sure you’re updated.**


  If you don’t see the call recording feature on your device, check your iOS version. Go to **Settings > General > About**, and you’ll find your current iOS version listed next to **iOS Version**. If you’re below 18, you’ll need to update your phone.


  To update, return to **Settings > General > Software Update**, and tap **Update Now**. Ensure your device is connected to Wi-Fi and has enough battery before beginning. Once your iPhone is updated to iOS 18 or above, the recording feature will become available automatically.


  This update makes recording calls a native, safe, and seamless experience for users who want to capture meaningful conversations—whether it’s for work, personal documentation, or simply saving a laugh for later.
