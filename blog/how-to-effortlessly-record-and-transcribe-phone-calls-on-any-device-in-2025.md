  ### Record Phone Calls on iPhone and Android


  **Both iOS and Android now support call recording natively—no apps required.**


  Call recording on mobile phones has come a long way, and in 2025, both iPhone and Android users can take advantage of built-in features to capture conversations effortlessly. With iOS 18, iPhones finally introduced a native recording function. After placing a call, just tap the call recording icon in the top-left corner. Everyone on the call will hear an audible notification that recording has begun, ensuring compliance with privacy laws.


  Once the call ends, the recording is saved in the Notes app, complete with a transcription. Android devices, using the official Google Phone app, offer nearly the same process. Tap the “Record” button once a call starts, and your phone will alert participants that the call is being recorded. When done, recordings appear in the Recents tab, and they’re easy to export or delete.


  Not every country allows call recording, so check local regulations. And if call recording isn't available on your device, use a simple workaround: place the call on speaker and record with another device. It’s not elegant, but it works in a pinch.

  ### Recording Phone Calls on Mac and Windows


  **With the right setup, your computer can record both your voice and system audio.**


  Recording calls on your computer—whether via softphones or mobile apps—is more complex but doable. On Mac, you’ll need an audio routing tool like BlackHole. After installing it, set up an Aggregate Device in Audio MIDI Setup to merge your input (mic) and output (system audio). Then, use QuickTime Player to start recording.


  Set QuickTime’s input to the Aggregate Device and hit record. You’ll capture both ends of the conversation. Save the file afterward, and don’t forget to reset your audio output settings. Alternatively, advanced apps like Audio Hijack let you manage audio sources with a cleaner interface—though they come at a cost.


  Windows users have it a bit easier. Enable “Listen to this device” for your mic in sound settings and use free software like Audacity. Set the host to Windows WASAPI and the recording device to “Speakers (loopback)” to capture both system audio and microphone input. Start your call, hit record, and when finished, export the audio for safekeeping.

  ### Don’t Forget the Landline: Old-School Recording Tips


  **Even with analog phones, there are clever ways to capture your conversations.**


  Landlines may seem outdated, but they still have their use—especially in rural or high-security environments. Recording calls from these devices requires creativity. The easiest solution is the speakerphone method: place your call, put it on speaker, and record it with another device like a smartphone or a digital recorder.


  Some older phones feature headphone jacks that can output audio to a computer or recorder, though you may need adapters. Another option is to use third-party services like Twilio. This cloud-based platform can route and record calls through a purchased number. While powerful, Twilio setups require configuration and may be overkill for casual use.


  Still, it’s good to know that analog solutions aren’t completely left behind. In certain use cases, they offer reliable and legal ways to record audio.

  ### Capture and Transcribe Video Calls with Ease


  **Whether you're using Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams, built-in recording tools simplify the process.**


  Video calls dominate modern communication, especially in remote work settings. Most conferencing platforms now support native recording and transcription features. On Google Meet, you can record calls from the Meeting Tools menu—if you’re a host or have an eligible workspace account. Similarly, Zoom users can enable recording under Account Settings and capture calls with a single click.


  These platforms automatically save your recordings to the cloud, focusing on the active speaker to create polished replays. Microsoft Teams and Discord offer similar recording options. If you frequently switch between platforms, consider using an AI meeting assistant that integrates with multiple apps and provides consistent recording and transcription across all calls.


  For those who want more control, screen recording software like Camtasia or CleanShot X allows for detailed configuration. These tools let you capture specific windows, system audio, and microphone input, making them perfect for custom workflows. If you prefer free solutions, apps like QuickTime (Mac) or OBS Studio (cross-platform) can do the job with a bit of setup.

  ### Transcribe Any Call with Built-in or External Tools


  **Get written records of your calls automatically—or upload recordings for easy transcription.**


  Once you've recorded your call, transcription is often just a click away. iPhone users get automatic transcriptions in the Notes app, and Android users can use Google’s Recorder app or Google Docs' voice typing to transcribe audio. But if your recording tool doesn’t offer built-in transcription, you’re not out of luck.


  Apps like Apple Notes and Microsoft OneNote now support transcription features. Drag your recording into a new note, hit play, and the software will generate a text version of your conversation. Mac users with Apple Intelligence can even generate summaries, while OneNote users can transcribe directly from uploaded audio.


  Need something more robust? There are dozens of online transcription services—like Otter, Rev, or Descript—that offer accurate results, collaboration features, and AI analysis tools. Many have free trials, so you can test them before committing to a subscription.
