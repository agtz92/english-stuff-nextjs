short-description: Illinois Senator Dick Durbin has introduced the Crypto ATM

  According to **NBC News**, Durbin’s bill would:


  * **Cap new users at $2,000 in daily transactions** and **$10,000 over a 14-day period**.

  * **Require ATM operators to directly communicate** with first-time users attempting transactions **over $500**.

  * **Mandate full refunds for fraud victims** who file police reports **within 30 days**.


  With **cryptocurrency ATMs now common in gas stations and grocery stores**, their use in fraudulent schemes has **become a major concern** for law enforcement agencies.

  ### **The Growing Threat of Crypto ATM Fraud**


  Senator **Durbin** emphasized that **scammers exploit crypto ATMs** by pressuring victims into depositing **large sums of cash under false pretenses**.


  **“As our technology has evolved and become more sophisticated, so have scammers,”** Durbin stated. **“Nefarious actors are now using intimidation and manipulation to scare Americans, particularly seniors, into dumping their life savings into cryptocurrency ATMs.”**


  The **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** reported that in **2023 alone**, scams involving cryptocurrency ATMs resulted in **$114 million in losses**.


  Fraudsters commonly **pose as government officials or law enforcement officers**, coercing victims into **making payments under the threat of legal action**. In one case, a **Springfield, Illinois store owner** removed a **crypto ATM** after noticing multiple elderly customers depositing large sums **while speaking on their phones**, seemingly under duress.

  ### **How the Bill Would Strengthen Consumer Protection**


  Durbin’s proposed legislation is designed to introduce **greater accountability for ATM operators** by requiring:


  * **State regulations to remain in effect**, as long as they are **not weaker than federal rules**.

  * **ATM companies to submit fraud prevention policies** to the **Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)**.

  * **Violators of the regulations to face fines of $10,000 per day**.


  Several states, including **Minnesota, California, and Vermont**, have already implemented **daily transaction limits** on crypto ATMs to combat fraud. **Durbin’s bill** would set a **nationwide standard** while allowing states to **enforce stricter rules if necessary**.

  With **cryptocurrency adoption expanding**, crypto ATMs play a key role in **bringing digital assets to mainstream users**. However, the **lack of regulation** has led to **increased risks**, prompting lawmakers to act.


  While consumer advocates support **stronger protections**, some crypto enthusiasts **fear overregulation** could **stifle innovation** and **limit accessibility** to digital assets. If the bill passes, it could **reshape the crypto ATM landscape**, introducing **stricter oversight and compliance measures** for operators nationwide.

  As the debate continues, one thing remains clear: **crypto ATM fraud is a
  growing problem, and regulators are taking notice**.
