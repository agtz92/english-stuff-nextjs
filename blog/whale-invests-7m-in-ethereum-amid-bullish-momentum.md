  ### Whale’s Accumulation Journey


  **A growing Ethereum portfolio worth millions**\

  According to Lookonchain, the whale purchased 1,800 ETH in their latest transaction, bringing their total Ethereum holdings to 39,600 ETH. With an average purchase price of $2,487 per coin, their portfolio now holds an unrealized profit of $54 million, demonstrating the long-term confidence of large investors in Ethereum’s potential.


  This whale has been actively accumulating Ethereum since May 2024, strategically adding to their holdings during market dips, such as when Ether dropped to $2,200 in September.

  ### Market Trends and Whale Strategy


  **Contrarian approach yields gains**\

  While some investors reduced their exposure to Ethereum amid bearish trends, this whale chose to hold and accumulate further. During a period of high net outflows in September, where over $493 million worth of ETH was sold by other whales, this investor remained steadfast, taking advantage of lower prices to expand their position.

  ### Ethereum Price Recovery and Future Outlook


  **Bullish momentum fueled by recent events**\

  Ethereum’s price has recovered to $4,067, driven by increased retail and institutional interest following Donald Trump’s election victory. Analysts at QCP Capital note that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are approaching critical levels. Options data for ETH suggest strong open interest around year-end, aligning with expectations of further upward movement.


  Historically, Ethereum has seen price surges in January post-halving events. QCP analysts predict that the options market is signaling higher prices, with risk reversals favoring calls starting in the new year.
