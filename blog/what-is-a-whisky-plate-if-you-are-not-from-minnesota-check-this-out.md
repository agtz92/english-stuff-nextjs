  ## W﻿hat are the consequences of having a Whisky Plate?


  The idea behind whiskey plates is not to ridicule and humble a driver, but rather for law enforcement. These special license plates signify that you have been in an incident before with DUI or DWI; this makes your car more appealing when on patrol so they can detain them faster than if it wasn't marked by suchIdentifying marks



  ## W﻿hat if someone commits DWI using my vehicle?


  Y﻿ou will be still forced to use the Whisky plates in your vehicle

  ## How can I avoid using Whisky plates?


  As of 2021, those who are convicted of DWIs in Minnesota can opt to install an ignition interlock device (IID) on their vehicle. This is a device that requires the driver to blow into it before the car will start. If the IID detects alcohol on the driver's breath, the car will not start.
