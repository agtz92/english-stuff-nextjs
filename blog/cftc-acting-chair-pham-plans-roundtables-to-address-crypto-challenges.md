  **Controversial platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket in focus**\

  Prediction markets, which allow users to wager on real-world outcomes, remain a divisive issue. While popular for their accuracy in predicting elections, they have faced criticism and legal challenges. Pham’s inclusion of prediction markets in these discussions could reignite debates about their public interest impact.
