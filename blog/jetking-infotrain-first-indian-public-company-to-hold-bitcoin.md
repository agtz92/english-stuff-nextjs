  ### The Move to Bitcoin


  **A bold step in corporate treasury management**\

  Jetking Infotrain announced the purchase of 12 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.2 million. By designating Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, the company aims to diversify its holdings and hedge against inflation, following trends established by global leaders like MicroStrategy and Tesla.


  With a $5 million market cap and $2 million in annual sales, Jetking's adoption of Bitcoin represents a significant leap forward for Indian businesses into the digital asset space.

  ### Aligning with Global Trends


  **Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset**\

  Jetking’s strategy mirrors global practices where companies use Bitcoin to protect their reserves from inflation and currency devaluation. The move highlights growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its potential to serve as a hedge in uncertain economic times.


  While global firms like Tesla and Coinbase have already implemented Bitcoin treasury strategies, Jetking’s adoption could inspire other Indian businesses to follow suit.

  ### Indian Context: Challenges and Opportunities


  **A cautious but evolving regulatory landscape**\

  India’s regulatory environment remains cautious regarding cryptocurrencies. In November, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) emphasized the need to understand the implications of digital currencies before rolling out its central bank digital currency (CBDC). However, Jetking’s decision may signal a shift in corporate attitudes toward digital assets in the country.


  Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar noted the potential for blockchain technology to improve cross-border payments and remittances, suggesting that India’s financial infrastructure may increasingly integrate digital assets.
