  ### Automate Demo Scheduling and Meeting Prep Like a Pro


  **Free your team from the endless back-and-forth of manual scheduling.**


  Scheduling meetings manually is a time-consuming chore that slows down your momentum and frustrates potential clients. It often takes multiple emails just to lock down a 30-minute call, especially when you're juggling several leads at once. This inefficiency can cost you deals that would otherwise convert with a well-timed demo.


  Ryan T. Murphy, Sales Operations Manager at Upfront Operations, found a way to eliminate this headache by leveraging Pipedrive's automation workflows. Once a deal reaches the "Demo Requested" stage, Pipedrive automatically sends the lead a Calendly link and sets a task reminder for the rep to follow up if no meeting is booked within 24 hours. This streamlined scheduling process not only saves hours each week but also boosts demo attendance rates.


  Going a step further, Ryan used Zapier to automatically generate Google Docs meeting agendas tailored to each lead, pulling in relevant data directly from Pipedrive. This ensures every sales call is personalized and productive. As Ryan puts it, automating these small but critical steps has greatly increased pipeline velocity and conversion rates. By removing the friction in scheduling and preparation, your reps can show up confident and informed—ready to close.

  ### Re-Engage Lost Deals with Smart Email Nurturing


  **Lost doesn’t mean gone—automate follow-ups to revive cold leads.**


  Too often, a “lost” deal is treated as the end of the road. But in reality, many leads are simply not ready yet. Rather than giving up on them entirely, sales teams can use Pipedrive automation to create nurturing sequences that re-engage these prospects at the right time.


  Akanksha Sharma from Botshot shares how their team transformed their follow-up process. Now, when a deal is marked as “Lost,” it triggers a tailored email sequence through tools like Mailchimp or Outfunnel. At the same time, the deal is moved to a dedicated "Lead Nurture" pipeline where automated touchpoints are scheduled over time.


  This approach ensures consistent engagement without burdening reps with manual follow-ups. As Akanksha explains, this tactic has led to higher reconversion rates and ensures that no potential client is forgotten. It’s not about chasing the deal—it’s about staying top of mind until the timing is right.

  ### Seamless Handoff to Customer Success with Pipeline Automation


  **Ensure a smooth transition from sales to onboarding with zero dropped balls.**


  One of the most critical moments in a customer’s journey is the handoff from sales to customer success. When done manually, this step is prone to errors, delays, and communication gaps that can hurt customer satisfaction and retention.


  Edward White, Head of Growth at beehiiv, tackled this issue by automating the transition process. As soon as a deal is marked “Won” in Pipedrive, the system automatically creates a new record in the Customer Success pipeline. This record is pre-filled with relevant deal details and assigned to the appropriate team member, eliminating the need for back-and-forth Slack messages or emails.


  The result? Onboarding now starts almost immediately, reducing time to engagement by up to 24 hours. Edward notes that the automation not only improved internal workflow but also made the new customer experience more consistent and professional. For any growing company, this kind of streamlined process is essential for scaling successfully.

  ### Automate Location-Specific Tasks for Compliance and Personalization


  **Trigger tailored tasks based on contact location to ensure compliance and speed.**


  If your sales process spans multiple regions or industries, manual compliance checks and follow-ups can eat up valuable time—and create room for costly errors. Automation helps mitigate those risks by handling location-specific steps automatically.


  At Swapped, CEO Thomas Franklin implemented a workflow that creates location-based follow-up tasks in Pipedrive. For instance, when a deal in the EU moves to the “Verification Complete” stage, Pipedrive triggers a task to send KYC compliance documents tailored to that jurisdiction.


  This smart automation saves each rep 4–6 hours per week and ensures nothing slips through the cracks. It also shortens the sales cycle by an impressive 21%. Thomas says it’s like giving every salesperson their own assistant. The automation keeps everything structured and compliant, freeing reps to focus on what they do best—selling.

  ### Automatically Assign Tasks Based on Deal Criteria


  **End the chaos and ensure clear ownership with automated task delegation.**


  In high-velocity sales teams, figuring out who handles what can be a major source of inefficiency. Manual task assignments often result in confusion, duplicated efforts, or worse—leads falling through the cracks. Automating this process brings order and accountability to the chaos.


  Dirk Alshuth, CMO of emma, shares how task automation has transformed their internal workflow. Now, when a deal enters the pipeline, it’s automatically assigned to a rep based on specific rules—such as region, deal size, or product interest. This ensures each opportunity is handled by the most qualified team member without delay.


  As a result, the emma team spends less time on internal logistics and more time engaging leads. With everyone clear on their responsibilities from the get-go, they’ve seen a marked improvement in deal progression and team efficiency. In a sales environment where timing and clarity are everything, this type of automation is a must-have.
