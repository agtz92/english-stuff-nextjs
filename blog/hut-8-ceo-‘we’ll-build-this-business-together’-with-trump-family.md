short-description: Hut 8 has partnered with the Trump family to launch American
  Bitcoin—a mining operation that begins at scale. CEO Asher Genoot says the
  goal is to create a “pure play” miner that produces BTC cheaper than buying
  it.

  ### American Bitcoin starts big


  **A new mining firm with instant scale and infrastructure**


  Instead of starting from scratch, Hut 8 contributed its rigs to gain an 80% stake in the new venture. The firm now controls a high-capacity mining operation from day one.


  The company plans to go public and hold mined BTC on its balance sheet, aiming to be a major player in the industry.

  ### A bet on American energy and politics


  **Mining and nationalism converge in a new narrative**


  Genoot framed the venture as a blend of crypto and U.S. infrastructure. “We believe in Bitcoin. We believe in America,” he said.


  The partnership with Eric Trump and American Data Centers signals strong political backing—something that could boost adoption at the state level.

  ### Strategic reserve of Bitcoin


  **Mining to hold, not sell**


  Rather than flipping coins, American Bitcoin will accumulate BTC long-term. This mirrors the Saylor model and creates a strategic reserve for future financial leverage.


  It also adds weight to calls for states to build crypto reserves—something Genoot hinted could become a trend.

  ### IPO on the horizon


  **Public listing planned as institutional demand rises**


  The company plans to go public, offering a clean path for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin mining without touching hardware or tokens.


  This could be a strong sell for funds that want BTC upside with traditional structure and accountability.

  ### Conclusion: political mining begins


  **The merger of mining, money, and politics takes center stage**


  American Bitcoin blends infrastructure, ideology, and investment in a powerful way. Whether this sets a trend or becomes an outlier remains to be seen.


  But with the Trump name, deep capital, and nationalistic overtones, this venture is positioned for impact.
