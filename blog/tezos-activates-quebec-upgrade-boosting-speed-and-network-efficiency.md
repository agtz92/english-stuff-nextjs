  ### Key Improvements in the Quebec Upgrade


  **Faster transaction speeds and reduced block times**\

  The Quebec upgrade reduces block time from 10 seconds to 8 seconds, enabling transactions to reach finality in just 16 seconds. This enhancement makes Tezos a strong contender for applications requiring rapid processing, such as gaming and payments, without increasing hardware demands on validators, known as bakers.

  ### Enhanced Staking Mechanics

  **More accessible and secure staking**\

  Quebec introduces significant improvements to Tezos' staking system, allowing bakers to accept external stakes up to nine times their own, compared to the previous limit of five. This adjustment enhances network security while making staking more attractive and inclusive for participants.


  Active participants now enjoy even greater rewards, earning three times the yield of delegators—up from the previous ratio of two times—thanks to refinements in the Adaptive Issuance mechanism. This ensures a better balance between staking rewards and inflation control.
