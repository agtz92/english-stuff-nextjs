short-description: Securitize COO Michael Sonnenshein believes the U.S. crypto
  industry has entered a new era, as regulatory hostility gives way to
  collaboration. With lawsuits dropped and the SEC engaging businesses directly,
  the stage is set for tokenized assets to flourish.

  ### A dramatic regulatory shift


  **From enforcement to engagement: U.S. regulators change tone on crypto**


  In a recent Bloomberg interview, Michael Sonnenshein pointed to a major shift in federal attitude toward crypto. Under the Biden administration, enforcement dominated the conversation. Today, the Trump administration is showing openness to innovation, appointing a crypto head at the White House and establishing an SEC task force that regularly meets with industry leaders.

  ### Tokenization becomes a practical solution


  **More than hype: Tokenized RWAs offer real benefits**


  At Securitize, tokenization is proving its worth. The firm has brought $2.5 billion in real-world assets (RWAs) onto public blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon. These tokenized assets range from U.S. treasuries to public equities, delivering features like daily dividends, real-time liquidity, and 24/7 market access—advantages unavailable in traditional finance.

  **BlackRock and Exodus pave way for tokenized finance**


  Sonnenshein highlighted Securitize’s partnership with BlackRock on the BUIDL tokenized treasury fund. This product allows real-time redemptions and use across DeFi platforms. Additionally, Securitize recently tokenized Exodus, a publicly traded company, demonstrating real institutional adoption of blockchain infrastructure.

  ### Explosive growth in tokenized treasuries


  **500% growth rate signals surging demand**


  Tokenized treasuries are seeing unprecedented adoption, with growth surpassing 500% year-over-year. Sonnenshein expects this momentum to continue, especially as regulators and industry leaders collaborate to improve access and revisit outdated investor classifications.

  ### The future depends on regulatory cooperation


  **Dialogue with the SEC is key to expanding tokenization**


  Looking ahead, Sonnenshein sees regulatory collaboration as essential to scaling tokenized markets. As the SEC transitions leadership, open communication will be critical for evolving RWA frameworks and modernizing accredited investor definitions.
