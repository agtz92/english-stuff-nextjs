short-description: Sam Altman’s Worldcoin project has gone from a controversial
  experiment to one of the most ambitious crypto ventures of the decade. By
  blending AI, blockchain, and biometric identity, Worldcoin is aiming to build
  a global financial and identity layer for the digital age. In 2025, it's not
  just a token—it's a movement. At 3minread.com, we explore how Worldcoin is
  changing everything from universal basic income to digital identity, and why
  it’s one of the most important crypto stories of the year.

  ### What Is Worldcoin and Why Does It Matter?


  **Worldcoin wants to give everyone on Earth a digital identity—and a piece of crypto.**


  Worldcoin, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, launched with a bold mission: verify every human on the planet using iris-scanning technology and distribute crypto in return. Users verify their identity through a device called the Orb, which scans their iris to generate a unique World ID. Once verified, they receive a weekly airdrop of WLD tokens.


  This model is meant to solve two major problems at once—proving personhood in a world of AI bots and distributing global financial access through crypto. In 2025, over 10 million people across 120+ countries have registered, and governments are beginning to pay attention.

  ### The Financial Side of Worldcoin


  **WLD token has become one of the top-performing assets of the year.**


  Since the start of 2025, the price of WLD has surged more than 400%, placing it among the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The growing number of verified users, combined with increased speculation and adoption, has made the token one of the hottest assets in the market.


  Beyond price, Worldcoin has created an ecosystem of wallets, DApps, and payment systems built around its identity layer. Its wallet app now allows users to send crypto, access DeFi tools, and even participate in voting mechanisms—all tied to their verified World ID, making Sybil-resistance a native feature.

  ### Controversies and Global Debate


  **Worldcoin’s iris scans sparked massive privacy concerns—but adoption continues.**


  From its inception, Worldcoin has been surrounded by controversy. Critics say the project’s biometric data collection is dystopian and raises serious privacy red flags. Despite reassurances from the team that all iris data is deleted and only a hash is stored, privacy advocates and governments continue to question the model.


  Still, adoption hasn’t slowed down. In developing countries, people are signing up in record numbers to access financial rewards and future benefits tied to the World ID ecosystem. The project's blend of utility and incentive has made it one of the most unique crypto adoption cases in history—even as it divides public opinion.

  ### Worldcoin and Universal Basic Income


  **The project’s long-term goal is to power a form of global UBI.**


  Sam Altman has repeatedly said that Worldcoin could become the infrastructure for universal basic income in a world increasingly driven by AI. As automation replaces jobs, Worldcoin proposes a model where verified humans receive ongoing crypto income as a safety net.


  While still in early stages, the vision is gaining momentum. NGOs and governments are exploring pilot programs using World ID to distribute aid and benefits with zero fraud. If scaled properly, Worldcoin could become the backbone of a decentralized, global welfare system—something never before achieved in human history.

  ### What’s Next for Worldcoin?


  **Worldcoin’s next chapter includes AI integration, DAO governance, and legal battles.**


  The team behind Worldcoin is rolling out new updates in 2025, including integration with AI agents, where your World ID could verify you're human during interactions with AI systems. The protocol is also preparing for greater decentralization via DAO governance, allowing token holders to help shape its future.
---
At the same time, legal challenges are intensifying. Regulators in the EU and Asia are launching investigations into data protection practices, and some countries have banned Orb devices outright. But Altman and his team remain focused on expanding and refining the project, believing that identity and financial access are two of the most critical components of our digital future.
