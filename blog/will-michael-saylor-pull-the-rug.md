short-description: Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) now holds 528,185 BTC.
  While many hail Michael Saylor as Bitcoin’s biggest bull, others fear he could
  trigger a catastrophic sell-off. Is Bitcoin truly decentralized if one man
  holds this much power?

  ### A Bitcoin titan with a controversial past


  **Michael Saylor walks a fine line between visionary and centralizer**


  With over 2.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply, Strategy’s holdings give Saylor unmatched influence. His vision is clear: accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible and hold long-term.


  But critics argue he undermines Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos by advocating for U.S. control, promoting stablecoins, and aligning with institutional finance.

  ### Legal baggage and history of controversy

  **MicroStrategy’s past raises trust issues**


  MicroStrategy once inflated earnings and faced SEC penalties. More recently, Saylor settled a $40M tax evasion case in Washington D.C.


  These controversies fuel skepticism about his true motives—and whether Strategy’s massive Bitcoin stash poses systemic risk.

  ### Could a dump happen?

  **Concerns grow over possible forced liquidation**


  Though Saylor insists he’ll “never sell,” Strategy has funded BTC buys through convertible notes. If Bitcoin crashes or sentiment turns, creditors may force asset sales.


  Goldman Sachs estimates a 50% BTC price drop could trigger market doubts by 2027, when major debt matures.

  ### Proof of holdings calms some fears


  **Custody confirmed, but concentration remains a red flag**


  Arkham Intelligence identified 96% of Strategy’s wallets, held via Coinbase and Fidelity. Yet even with transparency, the sheer scale of Strategy’s bag unsettles many.


  Saylor has 46% voting power, making liquidation unlikely without his consent—but that doesn’t mean risks are off the table.

  ### Conclusion: admiration or danger?


  **Saylor is both Bitcoin’s champion and its greatest centralizer**


  Even if he never sells, the concentration of power matters. Decentralization is Bitcoin’s core value—and Strategy’s influence challenges that.


  Until structural risks are addressed, Saylor’s presence remains both a strength and a looming threat.
