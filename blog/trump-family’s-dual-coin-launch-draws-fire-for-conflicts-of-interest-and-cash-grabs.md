  **Two tokens, one family, and a wave of market volatility.**\

  On January 17, Donald Trump announced the launch of the TRUMP token, a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. Days later, on January 19, Melania Trump followed with her MELANIA token, also powered by Solana. Both coins quickly gained traction, with TRUMP peaking at $75 and MELANIA at $13.73, highlighting their influence but also drawing criticism for market manipulation concerns.

  **Critics question motives, fairness, and centralization.**\

  The launches have faced significant backlash on platforms like Twitter, with accusations of cash grabs and exploitation of loyal supporters. Concerns about centralized ownership—88% of MELANIA’s supply reportedly held by 10 wallets—add fuel to the controversy. Some see this as a troubling trend that undermines the principles of decentralization.
