  ### Sustainable Candlestick DIY: Upcycle Your Way to a Cozy Winter


  The darker, colder months are perfect for transforming your space into a warm, inviting retreat. Rather than buying new decorations, why not embrace the charm of upcycling? This step-by-step guide will show you how to transform a simple plant pot into a stunning, sustainable candlestick to light up your holiday season.

  ### Measure and Prepare the Pot

  **Setting the foundation for your upcycled masterpiece**


  1. Wrap the rim of your plant pot with painterâ€™s tape to protect its surface.

  2. Use a measuring tape to determine the pot's circumference, then divide it by the number of candleholders (four in this case).

  3. Mark these points evenly around the pot, ensuring they are about 18mm from the rim.

  4. Drill the four marked holes using a 4mm metal drill bit, securing the pot with clamps to keep it steady.

  **Precision cuts for a flawless fit**


  1. Use the cordless jigsaw to cut four 15mm and four 160mm pieces from the 22mm beech rod.

  2. From the 6mm rod, cut two pieces approximately 21cm each. The exact length may vary depending on your pot size.

  3. Secure the rods on your workbench using clamps for clean, controlled cuts.

  **Prepping your materials for smooth construction**


  1. Drill 3mm holes in the center of each 15mm rod segment using a wood drill bit.

  2. For the 160mm rods, drill 1cm-deep holes 2cm from one end on two rods. On the other two, drill 3cm from the edge.

### Assemble and Affix the Candlestick

**Bringing all the pieces together**

1. Use superglue to attach the shorter 15mm rods to the center of each copper T-piece.
2. Align the T-pieces with the pre-drilled holes on the plant pot and affix them with screws and washers. Use the combi drill with an angle adapter for easier access inside the pot.
3. Insert the longer wooden rods into the open ends of the T-pieces, forming stable legs for the candlestick. Glue them in place for added security if desired.
