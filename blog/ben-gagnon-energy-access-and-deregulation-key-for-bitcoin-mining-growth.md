  ### Energy Markets and Geopolitical Challenges


  **Affordable and reliable energy remains essential for Bitcoin mining success**


  For over **200 years**, both the **US and Canada** have been energy-driven economies. However, ongoing **trade tensions and tariffs** could create instability in energy markets, potentially affecting Bitcoin miners.


  * **Quebec and Alberta** are primary locations for Bitfarms due to **competitive energy pricing**.

  * **Ontario** is less attractive due to its **weaker energy market and reduced capacity**.

  * **Regulatory support** is needed to maintain **stable energy costs** and ensure long-term growth.


  Gagnon emphasized that **deregulation and improved market access** are crucial for Bitcoin miners to expand their businesses.

  ### Strategic Acquisitions Strengthen Market Position


  **Bitfarms is expanding its geographical footprint to secure energy access**


  To navigate **regulatory and economic challenges**, Bitfarms has shifted its focus:


  * Increased **North American presence** from **40% to 80%**, with **66% now in the US**.

  * **Geographic diversification** ensures **better energy access and operational efficiency**.

  * **Transition of industrial energy infrastructure** to Bitcoin mining presents new growth opportunities.


  “For years, miners have been investing in energy assets once used for industries like **aluminum smelting**. As demand shifts back to North America, these resources are becoming highly valuable,” Gagnon noted.
