  ### **Grayscale Submits Proposal for Solana ETF**


  **Grayscale takes a step toward converting its Solana Trust into a spot ETF**


  On December 3, 2024, Grayscale Investments filed a proposal with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to introduce a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move builds upon Grayscale's existing Solana Trust, launched in 2021, which currently manages $134.2 million in assets. If approved, the Solana Trust could transition into a spot ETF, broadening access to Solana-based investments.

Grayscale highlighted the growing investor interest, with over a quarter-million U.S. investors contributing to Solana's $134.2 million in assets under management (AUM).

  ### **Competition Among Asset Managers**


  **Grayscale follows other players in the ETF race**


  Grayscale's move follows similar proposals from firms like 21Shares, VanEck, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, all seeking SEC approval for Solana ETFs. The increasing momentum comes on the heels of successful Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have set a precedent for broader crypto ETF adoption.

  ### **Solana’s Growing Market Presence**


  **Price surges and competition in the crypto market**


  Solana's market performance has been strong, with a 44% price increase over the past month, reaching $235. However, its market cap was recently overtaken by Ripple’s XRP, which saw an 81% surge in a single week. Despite this, Solana remains a critical player in the blockchain space, reinforcing the demand for a dedicated ETF.
