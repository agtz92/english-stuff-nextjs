  In this first look, we get a sneak peek at the House of Dragon with some
  interesting ground rules.

  "House of Thedragon will take place 200 years before Game Of Thrones starts," says writer George R.R Martin about what fans can expect from his new series which debuts next year on HBO!

  "Gods. Kings. Fire and Blood," a character says in George R Martin's "Fire &
  Blood" book, set hundreds of years before events on Game Of Thrones tv series
  adaptation by HBO cable channel. The line was later quoted back at him with
  humor: â€œdreams didn't make us kings; dragons did."

mk2: Imagine the royal family in your own backyard. Matt Smith, former star of
  Doctor Who and The Crown makes his return to TV where he plays Prince Daemon
  Targaryen - not just any member of royalty but one with dragon blood running
  through him!

  Steve Toussaint also stars as Lord Corlys Velaryon while Olivia Cooke takes on
  two roles: Alicent Hightower (Otto's daughter)and Rhaenyra NuTysaeg(princess).
