  ### A European Milestone in Digital Sovereignty


  **Pontus-X becomes Europe’s largest public data space, championing secure and decentralized data sharing.**


  Pontus-X, built on the Gaia-X architecture, serves as a backbone for the European Union’s digital independence. Developed by deltaDAO AG and launched at Hannover Messe 2025, this production-ready platform integrates the privacy-preserving features of Oasis Network to support confidential, compliant data exchange across borders and sectors. With more than 180 institutions onboarded—including aerospace giants like Airbus and OHB SE—Pontus-X represents a scalable, secure, and sovereign approach to managing Europe’s digital assets.


  The platform empowers industries such as mobility, AI, manufacturing, and agriculture with over 570 services already operational. By emphasizing interoperability, privacy, and federation, Pontus-X redefines how sensitive data can be processed and monetized without compromising security.

  ### Federated Sharing and Confidential Computing


  **A new standard for privacy-first data processing with hardware-level protections.**


  Pontus-X uses a federated model to ensure that organizations maintain control of their own data while engaging in collaborative ecosystems. A key feature is Oasis’s Sapphire ParaTime, which relies on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to ensure that data remains encrypted even during processing. This mechanism makes it possible for algorithms to analyze information without directly accessing it—a breakthrough for high-sensitivity fields like defense and space exploration.


  deltaDAO further elaborates that Pontus-X supports legally binding digital contracts aligned with the EU’s Data Act and MiCA regulations. These smart contracts enable traceability and legal compliance across member states, reinforcing trust and accountability throughout the data economy.

  ### Oasis Network: Privacy as a Service


  **Pioneering privacy-preserving tools to fuel a sovereign European AI ecosystem.**


  Oasis Network plays a foundational role in the confidentiality stack. In the Q&A, Oasis revealed how its Sapphire ParaTime provides a hardware-secured environment that offers both scalability and privacy. This approach empowers developers and enterprises to deploy decentralized applications that handle sensitive data responsibly and securely.


  The integration with Pontus-X illustrates a larger movement toward platforms that can satisfy complex regulatory frameworks while still promoting innovation. Oasis is positioning itself not only as a privacy provider but as a compliance enabler, bridging the gap between blockchain potential and legal practicality.

  ### The Business Case for Cross-Border Data Monetization


  **A path to sustainable, decentralized, and profitable data economies.**


  At the core of Pontus-X lies the principle of monetizing data in a lawful and ethical way. With strict adherence to EU laws, enterprises can now create services that exchange value without ever exposing private datasets. This unlocks opportunities for smaller organizations to participate in a growing European digital economy without sacrificing their autonomy or security posture.


  For developers, the ability to tap into sovereign infrastructure means fewer barriers to entry and lower compliance risks. The ecosystem not only allows for data usage but ensures it happens under clearly defined terms that are verifiable and enforceable through smart contracts.

  ### Looking Ahead: Europe’s Tech Stack for Sovereign AI


  **Why Pontus-X and Oasis may become the blueprint for data sovereignty worldwide.**


  Pontus-X could set a precedent for global data-sharing standards by proving that privacy, interoperability, and compliance are not mutually exclusive. The combination of federated control, TEEs, and legally sound smart contracts addresses the core needs of modern data economies. As AI continues to demand access to more and better data, systems like Pontus-X are poised to offer ethical and scalable alternatives to centralized cloud platforms.


  With the backing of prominent European entities and a growing number of ecosystem participants, Pontus-X is not just a pilot—it’s a glimpse into Europe’s digital future.
