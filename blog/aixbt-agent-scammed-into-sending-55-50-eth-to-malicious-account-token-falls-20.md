  #### **Manipulating AiXBT’s AI agent**


  * At **2 AM UTC on March 18**, the attacker **gained access to AiXBT’s autonomous system dashboard**.

  * By queuing **two malicious replies**, the hacker **redirected 55.50 ETH** from the Simulacrum wallet.

  * **AiXBT’s pseudonymous developer, rxbt**, confirmed that the AI itself was not compromised—only the **dashboard’s security controls were breached**.


  Despite the **core system remaining intact**, the incident **raised questions about AI-driven financial automation and security vulnerabilities**.

  #### **Sharp decline following the exploit**


  * **AIXBT’s token price plummeted nearly 20%**, trading at **$0.0938** within 24 hours.

  * The **market cap fell to $82.4 million**, a significant drop from **its $755 million peak in mid-January**.


  AiXBT **quickly responded** by reporting the hacker’s address to exchanges, **revoking compromised access keys**, and initiating a **server migration**. However, **investor confidence remains shaken**, with many questioning **the security framework of AI-driven trading platforms**.
