  Bo Hines, executive director of Trump’s presidential council on digital
  assets, reaffirmed the administration’s commitment to expanding the U.S.
  Bitcoin reserve. Speaking at a Blockworks event in New York on March 18, Hines
  emphasized the White House’s stance on acquiring and retaining BTC, following
  Trump’s recent executive orders on digital assets.


  Trump’s administration has moved swiftly on crypto-friendly policies, including a Bitcoin reserve audit and strategies to increase national BTC holdings. With an estimated 200,000 BTC already under U.S. control, the government is actively exploring “budget neutral” methods to accumulate more.

  #### **Key executive orders driving BTC accumulation**


  * **On January 20**, Trump signed two **Executive Orders** aimed at establishing a **digital asset regulatory framework** and a **U.S. Bitcoin reserve**.

  * **On March 6**, the White House **authorized an audit of current BTC holdings** to assess opportunities for future acquisitions.

  * The administration is exploring **cost-effective strategies** to expand reserves **without adding to the national deficit**.


  According to Hines, the approach mirrors **traditional gold reserves**, positioning **Bitcoin as a key strategic asset** for the U.S. economy.

  ### **Why the U.S. Wants More Bitcoin**


  #### **Strengthening the nation’s digital gold reserves**


  * Hines reiterated that the U.S. aims to **“have, retain, and build on”** its BTC holdings.

  * “I get asked all the time how much BTC we want. That’s like asking a country how much gold do you want? **As much as we can get**,” Hines stated.

  * **BTC’s role as digital gold** makes it a critical asset for **hedging against economic uncertainty and inflation**.


  While the U.S. remains **the world’s largest BTC-holding nation-state**, its dominance could be challenged by **upcoming legal rulings**.

  ### **Could the U.S. Lose Its Top Bitcoin Holder Status?**


  #### **Bitfinex BTC seizure and potential asset return**


  * The U.S. government’s **200,000 BTC** comes largely from **DOJ-seized criminal assets**, including the **Silk Road and Bitfinex cases**.

  * A recent **DOJ filing suggests returning 95,000 BTC** to Bitfinex in 2026.

  * If approved, the U.S. would fall behind China, becoming **the second-largest BTC-holding nation**.


  This raises questions about **how aggressively the U.S. will pursue further Bitcoin accumulation**, given potential **regulatory and economic implications**.
