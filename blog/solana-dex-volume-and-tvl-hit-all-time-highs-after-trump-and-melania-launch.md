  ### Impact of TRUMP and MELANIA Meme Coins


  **Fueling Solana’s growth**\

  TRUMP and MELANIA, Solana-based meme coins, have garnered billions in market capitalization within three days of launch. Their popularity drove increased activity on the Solana network, boosting both DEX volume and TVL. However, the coins experienced significant price drops shortly after, with TRUMP falling 26% to $37.50 and MELANIA dropping 47% to $4.48.

  ### Comparing Solana and Ethereum


  **Challenging the market leader**\

  While Ethereum remains the leader in TVL with $65 billion, Solana's rapid growth highlights its potential to rival Ethereum’s dominance. Over the past month, Solana’s TVL has grown by over 33%, whereas Ethereum’s TVL has decreased by nearly 5%. This trend positions Solana as a key competitor in the decentralized finance ecosystem.
