  ### Community Opposition to Crenshaw’s Policies


  **A history of dissent against crypto-friendly measures**\

  The Blockchain Association, joined by the DeFi Education Fund, filed a letter urging Congress to block Crenshaw’s re-confirmation. They criticized her record of opposing crypto-friendly decisions, such as voting against approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have become a significant asset class with over $109 billion under management.


  The association accused Crenshaw of failing to adapt to crypto's evolving role in the economy and disregarding Congress's mandate for sound regulatory frameworks.

  ### SEC Dynamics: Leadership Transition and Crypto Policies


  **Crenshaw’s stance versus the new leadership vision**\

  Crenshaw, who joined the SEC in 2020, has been a consistent ally of outgoing chair Gary Gensler, sharing his skeptical views on blockchain and DeFi. However, the crypto industry sees hope in Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto figure and potential successor to Gensler.


  If confirmed, Atkins is expected to champion balanced crypto regulations, contrasting sharply with Crenshaw’s approach. This shift could signal a significant change in how the SEC engages with blockchain and digital assets.

  ### Broader Industry Implications


  **The impact of SEC leadership on crypto’s future**\

  The potential re-confirmation of Crenshaw could extend her tenure until 2029, potentially stifling the industry’s growth under Trump’s administration. Conversely, the appointment of Atkins as SEC chair could foster a more constructive dialogue between regulators and the blockchain sector, paving the way for common-sense regulations.
