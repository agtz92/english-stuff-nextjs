  ### Rising Illicit Activity


  **The growth trajectory is alarming, with a 25% annual increase in illicit transactions since 2020.**\

  Chainalysisâ€™s 2025 Crypto Crime report reveals $40.9 billion identified in 2024 so far, though trends suggest the actual total could surpass $51 billion. This rapid rise highlights an ecosystem growing more sophisticated, with professional services emerging to facilitate these activities.

  ### Cybercrime Hotspots


  **North Korean hackers stole $1.34 billion through key compromises.**\

  AI-driven scams and sextortion schemes are on the rise, while ransomware groups continue raking in millions. Law enforcement actions, such as the takedown of Universal Anonymous Payment System, signal progress but fail to eliminate the threat entirely.

  ### A Shrinking Percentage?


  **Illicit activity fell to 0.14% of total on-chain volume.**\

  Although the proportion is declining, experts predict these numbers will climb as wallet attribution improves. The question remains: Can regulations keep pace with the evolving tactics of crypto criminals?
