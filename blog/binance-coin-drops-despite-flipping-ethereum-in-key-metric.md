  ### BNB Chain Surpasses Ethereum in DEX Volume


  **A major milestone for Binance Coin’s network amid market fluctuations.**\

  On Monday, data from DeFi Llama revealed that BNB Chain decentralized exchanges processed $5.7 billion in sales, surpassing Ethereum’s $5.05 billion. This surge positions BNB Chain as the second-largest network in DEX volume, trailing only Solana’s $25.3 billion. PancakeSwap led the gains, with $5.24 billion in volume, while competitors like Uniswap and DODO contributed to Ethereum’s figures.

  ### BNB Price Reaction Amid the Metrics Shift


  **Price drops despite network success, with upcoming catalysts in sight.**\

  BNB’s price dipped to $685, a 6.50% decrease from its weekend high. The price action reflects market sensitivity to broader events, including Donald Trump’s inauguration and macroeconomic factors. Traders are now looking ahead to BNB’s 30th token burn, set to remove 1.64 million tokens worth over $1 billion, as a potential catalyst for price recovery.

  ### Ethereum’s Layer-2 Competition Heats Up


  **Shifting dynamics as Ethereum faces challenges from layer-2 solutions.**\

  Ethereum’s dominance is being tested by layer-2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism, which offer faster and cheaper transactions. Base, launched by Coinbase in 2023, recorded $14 billion in weekly volume, narrowing the gap with Ethereum’s $21 billion. This migration of activity has contributed to Ethereum’s DEX volume decline.

  BNB has maintained its position above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages, key bullish signals. The cup and handle pattern forming on its weekly chart indicates a potential breakout, with price targets at $1,000 and $1,135. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD further support a bullish outlook.

  ### Market Outlook: Challenges and Opportunities


  **BNB and Ethereum face shifting market dynamics.**\

  BNB’s recent milestone demonstrates the strength of its ecosystem, but price performance remains tied to external factors and upcoming token burns. Meanwhile, Ethereum must address the competition from layer-2 solutions to sustain its relevance. As the market evolves, both networks will play pivotal roles in shaping the decentralized future.
