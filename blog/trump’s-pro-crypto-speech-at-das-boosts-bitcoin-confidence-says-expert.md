  U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a pro-crypto message during his keynote
  address at Blockworks’ Digital Assets Summit (DAS) in New York, signaling
  growing political and institutional acceptance of digital assets. According to
  Dan Greer, co-founder of DeFi App, Trump’s remarks affirm a clear and
  proactive stance from the current administration on cryptocurrency innovation.


  The address touched on stablecoin legislation, the proposed strategic Bitcoin reserve, and the challenges of crypto debanking. Trump called on Congress to enact “simple and common sense rules” for stablecoins, highlighting the importance of regulatory clarity as a driver of innovation in digital finance.

  ### Momentum Toward Pro-Crypto Regulation


  **Political Signals Align With Market Needs**


  The Senate Banking Committee advanced a stablecoin bill last week, and Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisers on digital assets, stated that the legislation could reach Trump’s desk soon. Dan Greer praised the administration’s tone, noting that “crypto is now a major force in finance.”


  The crypto industry has already seen regulatory tailwinds, including the SEC closing investigations and dropping lawsuits against major firms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini. These shifts are fueling optimism for a friendlier U.S. crypto environment.

  ### DeFi on the Rise


  **Congressional Support for Decentralized Finance**


  Earlier this month, the U.S. House voted to overturn the IRS broker rule that would have forced DeFi protocols to report user data. Experts have lauded the vote as a landmark moment, creating a more innovation-friendly legal climate.


  Greer emphasized that solving DeFi’s barriers—complexity, costs, and accessibility—requires smart regulation. He believes Trump’s administration is positioned to help drive mass adoption by providing the regulatory support the space needs to flourish.

  ### Strategic Leadership Opportunity


  **Why the U.S. Must Act Now on Crypto**


  “Failing to take this chance will push innovation offshore and see the United States fall behind,” Greer warned. His optimism lies in the possibility of crypto-friendly policies that can place the U.S. at the forefront of blockchain innovation.


  Trump’s recent initiatives include the first-ever White House crypto summit and an executive order proposing a **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR)**. He also made a surprise appearance at the Bitcoin Conference 2024, further cementing his visibility within the crypto space.

### The Road Ahead

**A Defining Moment for U.S. Crypto Leadership**

Trump’s pro-crypto messaging at DAS shows a strong political will to integrate blockchain into the U.S. financial system. As regulatory uncertainty fades, crypto companies are beginning to plan for long-term growth within American borders rather than abroad.

The momentum generated by Trump’s speech, paired with legislative and judicial developments, could make 2025 a transformative year for the crypto industry—one where the U.S. moves from cautious observer to global leader in digital finance.
