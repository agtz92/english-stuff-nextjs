  Coinbase has introduced Verified Pools, a new liquidity solution designed to
  enhance security and transparency in on-chain trading. Announced on March 18,
  this feature aims to reduce counterparty risks while maintaining
  decentralization by integrating identity verification with liquidity pools.


  Decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized asset trading without intermediaries, but anonymous liquidity providers have historically posed risks. Verified Pools addresses this issue by requiring users to verify their identity while participating in liquidity pools.
