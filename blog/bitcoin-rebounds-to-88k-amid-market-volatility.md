  ### Bitcoin’s Price Surge and Market Reaction


  **BTC pushes higher as market capitalization surpasses $3 trillion.**


  Bitcoin climbed 3% on March 4, reaching **$87,972** and helping the total cryptocurrency market cap reclaim the **$3 trillion** mark. Altcoins also saw modest recoveries, with XRP surpassing Tether in market rankings, while Solana and Cardano regained some lost ground.


  Publicly traded Bitcoin-holding companies such as **Coinbase and MicroStrategy** saw their stock prices rise by **4% and 10%**, respectively. However, questions remain about whether Bitcoin can sustain this momentum and push past the critical **$90,000** level.


  The **Bitcoin Volmex Implied Volatility 30-Day Index** extended its **four-day green streak**, signaling increased market fluctuations as investors navigate uncertain economic conditions.

  ### Analysts Predict Both Gains and Drawdowns


  **Experts forecast long-term growth but warn of potential pullbacks.**


  Crypto analysts, including **Fundstrat’s Tom Lee**, and financial institutions such as **Standard Chartered**, have projected that Bitcoin could hit **$150,000 to $250,000** by 2026. However, in the short term, some analysts warn of a potential **24% decline**, which could push Bitcoin below **$70,000** before it establishes a new cycle bottom.


  Despite recent gains, the market remains volatile, and investors should be prepared for fluctuations in both directions.

  ### Global Markets React to Tariff Tensions


  **Trade disputes add pressure to financial markets.**


  Stock markets across the **United States and Canada** reacted sharply to the latest tariff policies introduced by President **Donald Trump**. The **Dow Jones, S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and NYSE Composite** experienced increased turbulence as Canada threatened retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump's **25% tariff announcement**.


  Tech stocks like **Nvidia and Microsoft** had been posting gains before political tensions between Trump and **Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau** escalated. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies has added another layer of instability to an already volatile financial landscape.

  ### What’s Next for Bitcoin?


  **Can BTC break past $90,000, or is a pullback imminent?**


  Bitcoin’s latest price action highlights its resilience in uncertain times, but whether it can sustain a rally beyond $90,000 remains unclear. Market conditions, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors will likely play a key role in shaping Bitcoin’s next move.


  With volatility expected to persist, investors are watching closely to see if Bitcoin can maintain its upward momentum or if another correction is on the horizon.
