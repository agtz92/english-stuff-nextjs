  ### **Massive WLFI Purchase Raises Questions**


  **On-chain activity highlights growing political ties in crypto**


  The transaction, which took place in the early hours of **February 18**, was first reported by **On-Chain Lens**, a leading blockchain analytics platform. The purchase adds to the **ongoing controversy surrounding WLFI**, a crypto project that presents itself as a **DeFi lending platform** but has yet to introduce any real DeFi services.


  According to a **BitMart Research** report, WLFI has already raised **$455 million** through token sales, with a **first round of $319 million** (at $0.015 per token) and a **second round of $136 million** (at $0.05 per token). Despite these massive funds, the projectâ€™s primary activity appears to be **accumulating digital assets** rather than launching lending protocols or other financial services.

  ### **Trumpâ€™s Family Reportedly Controls 75% of WLFI Revenues**


  **Critics question the project's purpose and financial structure**


  While WLFI markets itself as a decentralized financial initiative, its strong **ties to the Trump family** have raised concerns about **potential conflicts of interest and financial motives**. Reports indicate that **75% of WLFIâ€™s token sale revenue is controlled by Trump-affiliated entities**, leading many to speculate that the project is more about **political fundraising** than financial innovation.


  Market analysts have compared WLFI to previous **Trump-affiliated tokens**, which have often **surged in value based on political sentiment** rather than utility. Given its **lack of clear utility** and Trumpâ€™s political influence, critics argue that the project may function as an **alternative funding mechanism** for Trumpâ€™s future political ambitions.

  ### **Justin Sun Becomes WLFIâ€™s Largest Institutional Investor**


  **TRON founder injects $75M into the project**


  The controversial founder of **TRON, Justin Sun**, has emerged as the **largest institutional backer of WLFI**, investing a staggering **$75 million** into the project. WLFI, in turn, has allocated **$63.41 million** to Sun-related assets, including **TRX (TRON) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)**, further entangling the project in high-profile crypto networks.


  This collaboration raises further **questions about WLFIâ€™s long-term intentions**, as its investment strategy leans more toward **building its asset reserves** than providing decentralized financial services.

  ### **WLFIâ€™s Growing Asset Portfolio and Strategic Holdings**


  **Heavy investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum signal accumulation strategy**


  Despite its lack of active lending services, WLFI has strategically diversified its assets. The latest **BitMart Research report** indicates that the project held **$47.49 million in stablecoins** before the recent token purchase and has moved **$307.4 million into Coinbase Prime** for custody.


  WLFIâ€™s investment approach focuses on increasing exposure to **Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Real-World Assets (RWAs)** rather than actively building a DeFi ecosystem. Analysts suggest that this move signals an attempt to **fortify its financial foundation** while positioning itself as a major player in the crypto space.
