  ### **SEC’s Path to Crypto ETF Approval in 2025**


  **The SEC’s stance on digital asset ETFs continues to evolve, with increasing calls for regulatory clarity.**


  While **Litecoin and Solana ETFs are expected to receive approval with 90% and 70% probability**, according to Seyffart and Balchunas, the broader discussion on **whether XRP and Dogecoin should be classified as securities or commodities** remains a key hurdle. Commissioner Hester Peirce’s crypto task force is actively working on addressing this legal ambiguity, with final ETF approvals anticipated by late 2025.
