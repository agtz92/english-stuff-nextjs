  ### **Aave’s v3 Deployment on Sonic**


  The deployment of Aave v3 on Sonic follows a governance proposal aimed at integrating the DeFi protocol into the network, formerly known as Fantom. The transition was led by Web3 developer bgdlabs, with risk assessments conducted by Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk. Chainlink’s oracle platform provides essential price feeds to ensure accurate market data.


  Sonic Labs launched its layer-1 mainnet in December 2024, the same month the AAVE community approved the governance proposal to bring v3 to the network. This move is expected to enhance liquidity and expand Aave’s ecosystem to new users.

  * **$800,000 in AAVE tokens** as additional rewards.

  ### **Why Aave Chose Sonic for Expansion**


  Aave’s expansion strategy has always focused on promising L1 and L2 Ethereum-compatible networks. The decision to deploy on Sonic was based on:


  * **Strong developer team** and network history.

  * **Innovative fee monetization model**, allowing DeFi apps to generate additional income.

  * **Scalability and efficiency** of Sonic’s layer-1 mainnet.


  Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje emphasized that Sonic is “the only chain where you get paid for the activity you create,” making it a compelling platform for Aave’s next stage of growth.

  ### **Aave’s Multi-Network Expansion Strategy**


  Since its launch on Ethereum in 2018, Aave has expanded across multiple blockchains, including:


  * **Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism**

  * **Base, Avalanche, and BNB Chain**

  * **Gnosis Chain and now Sonic**


  Currently, Aave has a **total value locked (TVL) of over $18.7 billion**, slightly down from its peak of $22 billion in December 2024.


  As Aave continues expanding, its integration with Sonic is expected to attract more users and liquidity, further solidifying its role as a leader in the DeFi space.
