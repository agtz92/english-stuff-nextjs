  ### A New Chapter in Crypto-Backed Insurance


  **$40 million fully funded with Bitcoin**


  Tabit Insurance announced the launch of a groundbreaking **$40 million facility capitalized 100% in Bitcoin**, calling it an "industry first." This move allows **real-time verification** by regulators and auditors, offering a level of transparency uncommon in traditional capital structures.


  The company will retain all capital in BTC, while **policies and premiums will remain denominated in U.S. dollars**. This hybrid structure aims to provide the advantages of cryptocurrency’s transparency with the reliability of fiat-based insurance operations.
