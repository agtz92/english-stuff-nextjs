  ### Ripple drops cross-appeal, SEC retains partial fine


  **Both parties agree to end litigation and close one of crypto’s biggest legal battles**


  Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty confirmed via X that the company has withdrawn its appeal after the SEC dropped its own last week. As part of the final deal, Ripple will pay $50 million out of the original $125 million fine, with the rest returned to the company from escrow. This effectively concludes a case that began in December 2020.

  ### SEC shifts tone under new leadership


  **Pro-innovation stance replaces aggressive enforcement**


  The SEC’s decision to end the case reflects a broader change in regulatory attitude. Since the departure of former Chair Gary Gensler, the agency has dropped multiple high-profile lawsuits, including against Coinbase and Kraken. Interim Chair Mark Uyeda has promoted dialogue, while the Crypto Task Force—now led by Commissioner Hester Peirce—has launched industry roundtables.

  ### Final steps pending Commission vote


  **Settlement must be ratified through formal SEC process**


  Although both parties have agreed to terms, the deal requires final approval from the Commission and procedural completion in court. Once done, Judge Analisa Torres is expected to lift the injunction imposed on Ripple. Legal observers believe the vote is a formality and that the resolution signals closure.

  ### Ripple sees momentum despite long legal fight


  **XRP’s position in crypto markets stabilizes post-settlement**


  The news has injected fresh optimism into the XRP ecosystem. Market analysts believe the resolution removes a significant overhang for Ripple and XRP, potentially paving the way for institutional adoption. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously hinted at ambitions to rival SWIFT in cross-border payments.

  ### Crypto regulation enters new chapter


  **SEC now focused on clarity and cooperation**


  The case’s conclusion fits a broader narrative: the U.S. crypto regulatory landscape is undergoing transformation. Trump’s expected SEC Chair nominee Paul Atkins is seen as crypto-friendly, and regulators are now prioritizing engagement over enforcement. Industry insiders anticipate a friendlier environment for digital asset innovation in the months ahead.
