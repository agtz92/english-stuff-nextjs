  ### Unlocking the Power of Community Servers


  **Turning on Community Server mode gives you access to tools that professionalize your server.**


  Switching to a Community Server is the gateway to Discord's most powerful features. By simply toggling a setting in your Server Settings panel, you enable tools that help with moderation, organization, and discovery. It’s more than just a name change—it’s a full-featured upgrade for community managers.


  Once enabled, Community Server mode allows you to apply for Discord’s Server Discovery, making your server visible to the public. This means people looking for a space like yours can find it more easily. You’ll also gain enhanced moderation options that track user behavior, helping you keep the environment safe and welcoming. Custom onboarding flows, announcement channels, and content filters also become available, creating a solid foundation for growth and structure.

  ### Streamline Member Experience with Onboarding Tools


  **Onboarding lets new members personalize their experience and understand your server rules.**


  First impressions matter, especially in digital communities. Discord’s onboarding features allow server owners to shape the way new users enter and explore the space. From choosing default channels to custom question prompts, onboarding is your opportunity to highlight what matters most.


  When someone joins your Community Server, you can walk them through a guided introduction with recommended channels, resource links, and welcome messages. This prevents overwhelm, especially on servers with many channels. You can also prompt new members with questions to assign them roles and channels based on their interests. To top it off, enable server rules screening to ensure everyone acknowledges the community guidelines before participating.

  ### Build Smarter with Server Templates


  **Server templates let you jumpstart your server design using proven setups.**


  Creating a new server from scratch can be daunting, especially if you're unsure which channels or categories to include. That’s where Server Templates come in. Found in your server settings, templates are pre-built structures for your server that you can apply and modify.


  While many templates online cater to gaming communities, you can easily adapt them to suit a brand, business, or fandom group. Apply a template to instantly populate your server with channels like #introductions, #general-chat, or #support. This saves you time and gives your server a professional structure right out of the gate. Once applied, you can rename, reorder, or delete channels as needed to better align with your community's goals.

  ### Turn Passion into Profit with Server Monetization


  **Monetization features let you earn from your content, community, and server features.**


  If you’re managing a thriving server, why not turn it into a revenue stream? Discord's built-in monetization tools allow you to offer exclusive perks through Server Subscriptions or one-time digital product sales via Server Shops. It’s a game changer for creators, educators, or business owners with premium content to share.


  Subscriptions let you lock specific channels behind paywalls, offer members-only emojis, and build a tiered membership system. Server Shops, meanwhile, allow users to buy roles, downloads, or perks à la carte. Getting started is straightforward: enable monetization in your Community Server settings and connect your payment processor. Just make sure you meet Discord’s eligibility criteria. This is a huge leap toward making your Discord server not only engaging but financially sustainable.

  ### Supercharge Automation with Bots and Zapier


  **Bots can automate repetitive tasks and connect Discord with your favorite business tools.**


  Bots are more than just fun gimmicks—they’re essential tools for scaling and managing your Discord server. From moderation to welcome messages, bots can automate many of the tasks that otherwise eat up your time. Discord’s App Directory makes it easy to find verified bots that suit your needs.


  Want even more customization? Use Zapier to connect Discord to services like Google Sheets, YouTube, Notion, or even RSS feeds. For example, you can automatically post new blog articles in a channel or assign roles when users complete a survey. Zapier allows for powerful workflows that reduce your manual workload while making the server feel interactive and timely. Whether it’s a birthday bot or a customer service integration, the right automation can make your community feel alive 24/7.

### Organize Discussions with Forum Channels

**Forum channels create space for focused, long-form conversations within a busy server.**

Text and voice channels are great for real-time interaction, but they aren’t always the best for persistent or structured discussions. That’s where forum channels come in. These channels allow users to create topic-specific threads that function more like traditional forum posts.

Creating a forum channel is as simple as selecting “Forum” when making a new channel. You can use these for tech support, recommendations, feedback, or niche topics that deserve their own space. Unlike regular threads that disappear, forum channels preserve the conversation history and encourage detailed replies. This makes them ideal for communities that thrive on in-depth dialogue or require help ticketing systems.

### Keep Chats Focused with Threads

**Threads provide a tidy way to isolate side conversations from the main chat.**

Sometimes, a conversation sprouts from a single message and threatens to overtake a channel. Threads offer a neat solution. These mini-discussions allow users to dive deeper into a topic without derailing the main conversation flow.

Threads can be started either from scratch or by hovering over a message and selecting “Create Thread.” Once created, the thread appears under the main channel but remains separate, keeping everything organized. You can even control how long threads remain visible before they auto-close. Threads are ideal for everything from quick polls to collaborative ideas, ensuring that no one misses out on the main discussion while still fostering engagement.

### Host Live Events with Stage Channels

**Stage channels are perfect for webinars, AMAs, and other audience-focused events.**

Live voice interaction brings a unique energy to digital communities. Stage Channels are built specifically for speaker-audience dynamics, where a select group speaks and everyone else listens—ideal for Q&As, interviews, or live talks.

Only Community Servers can create Stage Channels. Once you’ve set one up, you can either start a live discussion instantly or schedule it as a formal event. Moderators can promote attendees to speakers during the session, facilitating dynamic and inclusive conversations. It’s a powerful format for thought leadership and building trust with your community in real time.

### Gain Insights with Server Analytics

**Server Insights offer data to help you track, analyze, and improve engagement.**

Community building isn't just about vibes—it’s also about metrics. With Server Insights, you can monitor user behavior, track popular channels, and see how onboarding processes are performing. This feature is especially useful for large servers that need data-driven decisions.

To enable it, go to Server Settings and click “Server Insights.” Note that you’ll need 500+ members for full analytics, but even smaller servers can see valuable stats like welcome screen performance and announcement engagement. Armed with this data, you can optimize your content strategy, adjust channel relevance, and improve your community's experience over time.

### Empower Members with Reaction Roles

**Reaction roles let users choose their own roles just by clicking on an emoji.**

Roles are crucial for assigning permissions, creating access levels, and organizing members by interest. But manually assigning them can become a chore. That’s why reaction roles are so handy—they let users assign roles to themselves just by reacting to a message.

While you’ll need a bot to enable this feature, many are available for free, or you can build one using Zapier. Create a message listing different options—like pronouns, interests, or game preferences—and pair each with a unique emoji. Once members react, the bot handles the rest. This promotes autonomy, reduces admin burden, and makes onboarding feel interactive.

### Drive Engagement with Built-in Events

**Events keep your server buzzing with activity and help members stay in the loop.**

Discord’s Events feature gives your server a social calendar. Whether you’re hosting a livestream, group game, or team meeting, Events let you plan and promote them inside your server. Once created, the event appears in a special section and notifies members about what's coming up.

Set an event by choosing a location (voice channel, Stage, or even external link), and fill in the details—topic, description, time, image, and recurrence. Members can RSVP, see event previews, and even set reminders. It's a fantastic way to keep your server active and give people something to look forward to.
