short-description: RSS isn’t dead—it’s just hiding. Most websites still have RSS
  feeds, but they’ve buried them beneath layers of code or completely removed
  obvious links. If you're tired of scouring a site’s footer for that little
  orange icon, you’re not alone. At 3minread.com, we help you stay in control of
  your digital tools—and today, we’ll show you how to track content from nearly
  any site using RSS feeds, even if they don't want you to.

  ### The Simplest Trick: Just Add “/feed” to the URL


  **Start here—this one-line trick works on millions of sites.**


  Before diving into source code or automation tools, try this: go to the homepage of the site and add `/feed` to the end of the URL. For example:


  ```

  https://example.com/feed


  ```


  This works on a huge number of WordPress-powered websites (which make up over 40% of the internet). You might be surprised how often this works, especially for blogs, niche publications, and portfolio sites.


  If it doesn’t work, don’t worry—we’ve got more advanced ways to uncover the feed.

  ### Platform-Specific RSS Feed Tricks


  **Each major blogging platform has its own RSS format—and they’re easy to guess.**


  Even if a website doesn’t directly advertise its RSS feed, most blogging platforms follow standard patterns. Here’s how to find them:


  * **WordPress:** Add `/feed` to the end of any blog or category URL.

    * Example: `https://justinpot.com/feed`
  * **YouTube:** Paste a channel URL directly into your RSS reader. Most readers will convert it automatically. You can also export all your subscriptions via an OPML file.

  * **Medium:**

    * For a publication: `https://medium.com/feed/example-site`
    * For a user subdomain: `https://example.medium.com/feed`
  * **Tumblr:** Add `/rss` at the end of the site URL.

    * Example: `https://example.tumblr.com/rss`
  * **Blogger:** Add `/feeds/posts/default` to the blog’s homepage.

    * Example: `https://example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default`

  Try these shortcuts before diving into more technical methods—they work more often than you’d think.

  ### Advanced Method: Digging Through Source Code


  **If all else fails, the site’s HTML might hold the RSS feed URL you need.**


  Here’s how to find it in the source code:


  1. **Right-click** anywhere on the site and choose **View Page Source**.

  2. Press **Ctrl+F** (or **Cmd+F** on Mac) to open the search bar.

  3. Search for keywords like `rss`, `atom`, or `xml`.


  Look for `<link>` tags with a type like `"application/rss+xml"` or `"application/atom+xml"`. The `href` attribute is usually the feed URL.


  Example:


  ```


  ```


  Copy that link and paste it into your RSS reader. Voilà—you’re subscribed.

  ### Can’t Find It? Build Your Own RSS Feed With Zapier


  **When a site refuses to give you a feed, make your own in minutes with Zapier.**


  Not all websites publish RSS feeds anymore. But with **Zapier’s RSS by Zapier**, you can create feeds from scratch using automation triggers. Some powerful use cases include:


  * **Reddit:** Create RSS feeds for new hot posts or filtered search terms

  * **Google Sheets:** Turn new spreadsheet rows into RSS items

  * **Google Docs/Drive:** Create a feed for file updates or new documents

  * **Slack or GitHub:** Track messages, issues, or commits via RSS

  * **Facebook Pages and Instagram:** Monitor new posts and activity


  Each Zap can feed into a custom RSS URL Zapier generates. Then, use that feed in any RSS reader, or trigger additional automations (like sending updates to email or posting to Slack).


  This method is particularly useful for tracking data from internal tools, private databases, or social platforms without native RSS support.

  ### Pro Tips for Smarter RSS Usage


  **Once you’ve found (or created) a feed, make it actually work for you.**


  * **Use Feedly, Inoreader, or NetNewsWire** for a smooth reading experience.

  * **Combine multiple feeds** using tools like RSS Mix or Zapier.

  * **Use filters** to only see posts that match certain keywords.

  * **Set up email alerts** from RSS updates if you prefer inbox notifications.

  * **Automate actions**—use Zapier to send RSS updates to Slack, Trello, or your calendar.


  And remember, you can build workflows where RSS is the trigger, not just the output. It’s an incredibly flexible format once you harness it properly.

### The Takeaway: RSS Isn’t Dead—It’s Just Disguised

**With a few URL tricks and some automation tools, RSS is as powerful as ever.**

In a world increasingly driven by algorithms and walled gardens, RSS remains one of the last bastions of user-controlled content. Whether you’re monitoring your competitors, tracking niche publications, or just organizing your own reading habits, RSS is your secret weapon.

And with tools like **Zapier**, you’re not limited to traditional feeds. You can turn almost anything into an RSS feed—and turn those feeds into powerful automations.

So next time you land on a blog or a service that doesn’t show an RSS feed, don’t give up. You’ve got the tools to find—or build—your own.

Happy subscribing.
