short-description: In a recent interview with Bloomberg TV, Ledger CEO Pascal
  Gauthier highlighted the critical need for robust security measures in the
  ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. He warned that while Bitcoin’s
  blockchain is inherently secure, the platforms where digital assets are
  stored—including crypto exchanges—continue to be prime targets for hackers.

  ### **The Importance of Self-Custody in Crypto Security**


  Bitcoin was **designed to be immutable and decentralized**, allowing users to have **full control over their funds**. However, many individuals **store their assets on exchanges**, which introduces **security vulnerabilities**.


  Gauthier strongly advised against this practice, stating:\

  **“Don’t leave your coins on an exchange. If you do, ensure their security measures are virtually impenetrable.”**


  Ledger, a leader in **hardware wallet technology**, has spent the past **10 years refining security protocols**, providing users with **a safer alternative** through self-custody solutions. According to Gauthier, these tools allow individuals to **retain full ownership** over their crypto assets, reducing the risk of theft.

  ### **Lessons from Major Crypto Security Breaches**


  Gauthier’s comments come in the wake of a **massive $1.5 billion hack targeting Bybit** on **February 21**. Hackers infiltrated the exchange’s **Ethereum cold wallet**, successfully bypassing **multi-signature security protocols**.


  Blockchain analysts linked the breach to **North Korea’s Lazarus Group**, a **notorious hacking syndicate** responsible for **several high-profile cyber thefts** in recent years. The attack further reinforced concerns about **security vulnerabilities** in centralized exchanges.


  These incidents serve as a stark reminder that **no exchange is entirely safe**, making **self-custody wallets a necessary security measure** for crypto investors.

  ### **Hardware Wallets: A Superior Security Solution**


  While **banks offer deposit protection**, traditional finance has **secure alternatives to storing cash at home**. Similarly, **hardware wallets** provide a **reliable solution for digital assets**, shielding users from **exchange hacks and cyberattacks**.


  Ledger’s technology, with over **eight million hardware wallets sold**, remains **one of the most trusted self-custody options** in the industry. Unlike **keeping cash under a mattress**, **hardware wallets are designed to offer maximum security**, ensuring that private keys remain **completely offline and inaccessible to hackers**.


  **Gauthier reiterated that crypto investors must prioritize personal responsibility**, stressing that **relying on centralized platforms** carries **unnecessary risk**.

  ### **The Future of Crypto Security**


  As the crypto sector continues to expand, so do the **threats from hackers and cybercriminals**. Governments worldwide are **introducing new regulations** to strengthen security, but ultimately, **individual users must take proactive steps to safeguard their digital assets**.


  With **self-custody solutions gaining traction**, companies like Ledger are at the forefront of **enhancing blockchain security**, ensuring that investors can navigate the crypto space **with confidence**.

  As **hackers become more sophisticated**, Gauthier’s warning serves as a
  **crucial reminder**:\

  **“If there is money, there will be hackers. The best defense is personal security.”**
