  Humans of New York is a page that will make you feel good. It's a beautiful collection of the diversity, beauty, and strangeness of New York City told through portraits of everyday people by photographer Brandon Stanton. 


  "Humans of New York began as a photography project in 2010. The initial goal was to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers on the street, and create an exhaustive catalogue of the cityâ€™s inhabitants. Somewhere along the way, I began to interview my subjects in addition to photographing them. And alongside their portraits, I'd include quotes and short stories from their lives."


  If you ever need to recover faith in humanity after a hard and long day, check out the page Humans Of New York. 


  Fun fact: There are plenty of pages named "Humans of ...." inspired by this project. Maybe you will find "Humans of your city"
