  ### Market Sentiment Deteriorates Rapidly


  The **Fear and Greed Index**, which ranges from **0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed)**, has fallen **24 points in a single day**, shifting from **Neutral (49)** to **Extreme Fear (25)**. The last time it reached similar levels was in **2024**, when it hit **22**.


  This sharp decline coincides with a **broader crypto market sell-off**, where major assets have suffered significant losses:


  * **Bitcoin (BTC):** Falls below **$93,000** (-3.82%)

  * **Ethereum (ETH):** Drops **10%**

  * **Solana (SOL):** Plunges **14%**


  Additionally, **Bitcoin ETF withdrawals have exceeded $1 billion** in the past two weeks, contributing to the market's negative outlook.

  ### Liquidations Surge as Open Interest Declines


  Market data from **Coinglass** highlights a severe impact on leveraged positions:


  * **$957.85 million** liquidated in the last 24 hours

  * **$886.47 million** from **long positions**

  * **Open interest** down **5%** to **$108 billion**


  The spike in liquidations suggests an **overly bullish market stance** that has now reversed, triggering a **cascade of sell-offs**.

  * **Higher-than-expected inflation data** has led to concerns that the **Federal Reserve** may **delay interest rate cuts**.

  * The **$1.4 billion Bybit hack**, one of the **largest exchange exploits ever**, has raised **security fears** despite Bybit covering the losses.
