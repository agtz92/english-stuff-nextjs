  ### BNB Faces Deep Correction


  **Technical breakdown follows failure to breach $798 high**


  BNB recently entered a corrective phase after forming a swing failure pattern near its all-time high of $798. Since then, the price has declined without a confirmed bottom. The current market structure suggests continued downside unless strong bullish momentum emerges.

  ### $400 Support Gains Significance

  **A multi-signal zone could offer stability and reversal opportunity**


  The $400 psychological level is supported by several confluences: the 200-week moving average, 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, and a major weekly swing low. Despite a brief dip below this value zone, no strong bullish reversal has yet occurred. If momentum fails to shift, a full test of this level appears likely.

  ### BNB Retains Market Cap Lead Over Solana


  **Outperforming SOL despite sector-wide weakness**


  While the broader crypto market is under pressure, BNB has maintained a higher market capitalization than Solana, signaling investor confidence. This relative strength may position BNB to recover more quickly when bullish sentiment returns.

  ### Short-Term Trends Still Bearish


  **No trend reversal means more downside possible**


  Lower timeframes remain tilted toward bearish price action. Without a clear structural shift or surge in buying volume, BNB could continue drifting downward. The $400 level remains a critical battleground for bulls and bears alike.

  ### Longer-Term Setup May Favor Recovery


  **Confluences suggest a possible rebound if demand returns**


  Despite near-term weakness, technical indicators support the idea that the $400 zone may become a key turning point. If demand builds at this level, BNB could stage a significant recovery and re-enter the long-term range above.
