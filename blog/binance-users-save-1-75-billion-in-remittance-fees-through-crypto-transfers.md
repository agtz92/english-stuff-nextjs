  ### The Global Context of Remittances


  **A high-cost necessity for many**\

  With global remittance volumes projected to reach $913 billion in 2025, the cost of traditional transfers remains a pressing issue. Binance's fee-free model offers a critical alternative, especially in lower-income regions where every dollar counts.


  In 2024, the average remittance on Binance was $470. Under traditional financial services, this amount would incur approximately $31 in fees, showcasing the substantial savings provided by crypto transfers.
