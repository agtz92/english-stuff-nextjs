short-description: I had the incredible opportunity to experience The Book of
  Mormon musical in London last September. My brother was eager to see it and I
  wasn't sure what to expect, but I ended up having a blast. I laughed
  throughout the entire show and don't regret going for a second - it was an
  unforgettable experience that truly set it apart from watching a play on
  Broadway in New York City!

  I recently had the opportunity to experience The Book of Mormon, a musical comedy currently playing on Broadway and all over the world. I certainly wasn't disappointed by this Tony Award-winning show! Written by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with composer Robert Lopez, this hilarious musical takes us on a wild journey to Northern Uganda with two mismatched missionaries. 


  I was in London last September and if you have been lucky to be there at any moment of your life, West End (The UK equivalent of Broadway) located near Picadilly Circus, comes out as an impressive and beautiful area. Broadway is amazing, but West end has something that just feels completely different.


  Mormons are located all over the world, however, most of them are in the US. The first thing that I was glad to notice is that all actors had an American accent, making the show more authentic and I felt like I was living the story the way it should, the way it was written.

  Now you should be aware that this musical, may come off as blasphemous, unorthodox and downright crass. But I'm here to assure you that at its core, The Book of Mormon is just as sincere and wholesome as any Rodgers and Hammerstein show. 


  It's clear that The Book of Mormon is no ordinary musical - it has something important to say about human connection and our shared humanity.

  The show combines sharp wit, absurdist humor and catchy songs to tell the story of Elder Price and Elder Cunningham’s mission to convert a local Ugandan village. Along the way they learn valuable lessons about faith and friendship, while also dealing with some unexpected challenges.


  The original production played over 800 performances on Broadway before closing in January


  Since then, touring companies have performed around the world. There have been successful productions in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe as well as Japan and Korea.

  Despite its irreverent take on Mormonism, The Book of Mormon is far from blasphemous; it actually celebrates faith through its characters’ trials and tribulations. Its central message is that human beings need each other - religious beliefs are secondary to our common humanity - something we rarely see addressed on stage. Its loyal fan base continues to grow every year as more people become aware of its sheer brilliance! 


  The songs were extremely good. From You and Me (But Mostly Me) , Turn It Off, All-American Prophet and the Tony Winner "I Believe" I laughed and enjoyed each one of them and the whole audience was laughing out loud for the duration of the play.

  The Book of Mormon is not only great entertainment; it is also a reminder that no matter how different we are from each other we all share a common goal - to be happy! If you get a chance to see this spectacular show don't miss it - you'll be surprised at how much thought-provoking fun you will have![](https://www.3minread.com/broadway-show-review-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/)
