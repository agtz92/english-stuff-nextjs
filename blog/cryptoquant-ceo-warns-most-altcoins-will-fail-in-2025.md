  ### Selective Altseason: The End of Broad Market Rallies


  Ju emphasized that 2025 will not resemble past bull runs where all cryptocurrencies experienced massive gains. Instead, he predicts a **"selective altseason,"** where only projects with strong fundamentals will succeed.


  He identified three key factors that could determine an altcoin’s survival:


  * **Potential ETF approvals** increasing institutional adoption

  * **Sustained user engagement** driving transaction volume

  * **Revenue generation** ensuring long-term sustainability

  Crypto analysts are optimistic about ETF approvals extending beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimate approval probabilities for several altcoins:


  * **Litecoin (LTC):** 90%

  * **Dogecoin (DOGE):** 75%

  * **Solana (SOL):** 70%

  * **XRP (Ripple):** 65%


  Additionally, Franklin Templeton has filed for a **spot Solana ETF**, while Brazil is set to launch the world’s first **spot XRP ETF**, further fueling institutional interest in altcoins.

  ### Favoring Projects with Real-World Adoption


  Ju highlighted that **sustained user activity** is now a crucial factor in an altcoin's success. Unlike previous cycles, investors are shifting their focus to **ecosystems with real-world utility, high transaction volumes, and strong fee generation.**


  This shift suggests that projects lacking tangible use cases may struggle to retain value in 2025.

  ### Revenue Generation: The Key to Long-Term Viability


  The days of altcoins thriving on speculation alone appear to be fading. Investors are now prioritizing **revenue-generating projects with sustainable business models.** This evolution marks a departure from previous bull runs, where hype and speculation often fueled market rallies.

  VWith regulatory clarity improving and ETF approvals advancing, the crypto
  market is moving toward a more **fundamentally driven** landscape. As a
  result, altcoins lacking strong financials and active user bases may face a
  **harsh reality** in the coming year.
