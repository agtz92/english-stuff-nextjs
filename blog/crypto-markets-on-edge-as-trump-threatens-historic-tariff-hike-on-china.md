  ### Trump’s Trade War Ramps Up


  **New threat would double tariffs if China doesn’t retreat**


  Trump warned that unless China withdraws its 34% retaliatory tariffs by April 8, the U.S. will impose an additional 50% tariff starting April 9. This would raise the total effective tariff on Chinese goods to 104%, with certain sectors like autos and electronics hit even harder.

  ### Market Volatility Spikes


  **Bitcoin surges then drops amid panic and speculation**


  Following Trump’s social media post, Bitcoin jumped to a high of $81,119 before falling back to $78,321. The price action reflects extreme uncertainty, as investors brace for ripple effects across inflation, trade, and consumer demand.

  ### Historical Context Raises Alarm


  **Tariff levels not seen since the Great Depression**


  The average U.S. tariff rate rose to 18.8% after the April 2 “Liberation Day” declaration, the highest since the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930. Analysts warn such moves could trigger a broader downturn, particularly if other nations respond with retaliatory measures.

  **Polymarket odds shift rapidly as traders weigh Trump’s strategy**


  On Polymarket, 59% of users now believe Trump will reverse most of these tariffs by July. This figure rose sharply from 33% just a day earlier, indicating a belief that the president may be bluffing or will negotiate a soft landing.

  ### $1 Trillion Crypto Wipeout Since February


  **Risk aversion leads to massive outflows in digital assets**


  Crypto markets have lost over $1 trillion in value since February, driven by macro fears and reduced liquidity. The uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade policy is pushing investors away from risk assets, with Bitcoin now behaving more like traditional equities in its response to economic shocks.
