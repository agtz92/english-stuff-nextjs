  ### Russia's Push for a Bitcoin Reserve


  **A call for innovation in national finance**\

  Anton Tkachev, a deputy in the Russian State Duma, has proposed creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. This comes after U.S. sanctions put pressure on the Russian economy and its business landscape. Tkachev's argument emphasizes Bitcoin's borderless blockchain system, positioning it as an essential reserve asset alongside traditional currencies.
