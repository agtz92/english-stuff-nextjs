  ### **Why This Partnership Matters**


  VASPs are critical to the growth of the crypto industry, enabling both retail and institutional adoption. However, these platforms carry inherent risks, including exposure to illicit activities. Chainalysis’ “know-your-VASP” feature already allows users to analyze on-chain transactions, helping identify potential threats.


  Now, with Lukka’s data solutions, Chainalysis can combine **on-chain and off-chain data** for a more robust risk assessment. This integration includes regulatory licenses, legal entity details, and jurisdictional information, enhancing due diligence for financial institutions, crypto businesses, and regulators.

  ### **How Off-Chain Data Enhances Risk Management**


  The integration with Lukka significantly improves VASP monitoring capabilities:


  * **Comprehensive Risk Profiles:** Users can evaluate both on-chain activity and off-chain attributes, gaining a clearer picture of potential threats.

  * **Regulatory Insights:** Access to real-time data on regulatory compliance helps businesses stay ahead of legal obligations.

  * **Automated Alerts:** Organizations receive notifications when risk scores change, enabling proactive risk management.


  This dual-layered approach is especially critical as the crypto industry faces rising threats. In 2024 alone, illicit addresses received over $40 billion, highlighting the need for more advanced monitoring tools.
