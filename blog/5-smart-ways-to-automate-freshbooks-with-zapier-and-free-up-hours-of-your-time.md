  ### Automatically Create FreshBooks Clients and Invoices


  **Stop manually copying client details and let automation do the heavy lifting.**


  When a new client books your services through a form on your website, your next step usually means opening FreshBooks, creating a new client record, then drafting an invoice—before the real work even starts. If you’re picking up leads through tools like Typeform, Jotform, HubSpot, or even Google Sheets, doing this by hand quickly becomes a bottleneck.


  That’s where Zapier steps in. By connecting your form or CRM to FreshBooks, you can automatically create a client record and even generate a new invoice each time someone submits their details. Whether it’s pulling data from a spreadsheet row or syncing with HubSpot company updates, your FreshBooks stays perfectly up to date without a single manual import.


  No more missed client details or forgotten invoices. This means faster onboarding, less admin stress, and a smoother experience for every new customer—so your growing workload doesn’t slow down your operations.

  ### Keep Payments and Financial Records in Sync


  **Maintain a crystal-clear view of your finances by connecting FreshBooks to your payment platforms.**


  If your business accepts payments through Stripe, PayPal, Square, Shopify, or WooCommerce, you know how messy it can get to keep everything updated. Manually transferring payment records into FreshBooks risks typos, missed transactions, or delayed reconciliations—problems that become headaches at tax time.


  With Zapier, you can automatically create income or expense records in FreshBooks every time a payment happens on your other platforms. Imagine Stripe payments instantly showing up as income in FreshBooks or WooCommerce orders automatically triggering new invoices.


  This real-time syncing means your books are always accurate, so you can track profitability, prep taxes, and make informed business decisions without second-guessing your numbers. You stay compliant and confident—without the time sink of manual entry.

  ### Get Instant Alerts for Invoices and Estimates


  **Know exactly when money hits your account or when estimates change, without manually checking FreshBooks.**


  Staying on top of payments is crucial for any small business or freelancer. Instead of constantly refreshing FreshBooks or risking that an important update slips through the cracks, set up automated notifications.


  With Zapier, you can instantly push FreshBooks updates into Slack or Discord, or even trigger an email to yourself (or your team) when an invoice gets paid or an estimate is updated. You choose the channel and the details you want included.


  These notifications keep your team in sync—your finance person knows when money lands, your account manager knows when to start work, and you never miss a beat on critical cash flow changes. No more chasing down updates; they come directly to you.

  ### Log Your FreshBooks Data in Spreadsheets or Databases


  **Turn FreshBooks activity into a living dashboard in Google Sheets, Airtable, or Notion.**


  Spreadsheets and collaborative databases are still the favorite tools of many small business owners for tracking revenue, expenses, and trends. But if you’re manually exporting FreshBooks reports or retyping data, you’re wasting time—and risking costly mistakes.


  By using Zapier, every time you create a new invoice or expense in FreshBooks, a matching row can appear automatically in Google Sheets, a new Airtable record can be generated, or a fresh Notion database item created. This means your financial overview stays perfectly up to date without you lifting a finger.


  From there, you can add charts, run automated AI insights, or share live dashboards with your team. Your financial data becomes a powerful, always-current resource for spotting trends or prepping reports.

  ### Trigger Follow-Up Tasks Without Manual To-Dos


  **Connect FreshBooks to your project management tools so no client falls through the cracks.**


  Picture this: you create a new client or send out an estimate in FreshBooks. Instead of manually hopping into Asana, Trello, Monday.com, or ClickUp to add the next task or project, Zapier can handle it automatically.


  With just a simple automation, new invoices, clients, or estimates can trigger:


  * New Asana or Todoist projects so your team starts work immediately.

  * Trello cards for visual pipelines.

  * ClickUp tasks to follow up on estimates.

  * Monday.com items to keep operations on track.


  This closes the gap between finance and project delivery, making sure that once the paperwork is done, the real work kicks off right away. Your team gets notified and aligned, and nothing slips through the cracks.
