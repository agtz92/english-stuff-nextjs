  ### **Roger Ver Fights Indictment Over Tax Evasion Claims**


  **Crypto pioneer denies wrongdoing and challenges U.S. tax laws**


  Roger Ver has filed a motion to dismiss a U.S. indictment accusing him of evading $240 million in taxes from Bitcoin sales. Arrested in Barcelona earlier this year, Ver is charged with underreporting Bitcoin holdings and failing to pay an "exit tax" upon expatriating. His legal team claims the charges stem from political bias and misuse of attorney-client communications.

  ### **Key Allegations in the Indictment**


  **Government outlines Ver’s alleged tax evasion tactics**


  The indictment states that Ver held over 131,000 Bitcoins across his companies MemoryDealers and Agilestar in 2014. Despite the assets being valued at $871 per Bitcoin, Ver allegedly evaded taxes totaling $48 million. U.S. prosecutors also allege Ver failed to declare these holdings properly, circumventing a required "exit tax" upon renouncing U.S. citizenship.

  ### **Defense Arguments Against the Charges**


  **Ver cites lack of clear crypto regulations at the time**


  Ver’s defense argues that during 2014, regulatory guidance on crypto taxation was ambiguous, making compliance challenging. His attorneys further claim the indictment is politically motivated, emphasizing that clear IRS guidelines on crypto taxation only emerged years later. Ver insists his actions followed professional advice available at the time.

  ### **Crypto Community Reacts to the Case**


  **Critics label the charges as politically motivated**


  The case has sparked outrage among crypto advocates, who view it as part of a broader "anti-crypto" agenda by the U.S. government. Civil rights attorney Robert Barnes called the charges an example of "lawfare" targeting the crypto industry. Critics hope that a more crypto-friendly stance under the incoming U.S. administration will shift enforcement priorities.
