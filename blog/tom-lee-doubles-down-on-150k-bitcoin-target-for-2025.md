  ### Bitcoin’s Weak March: A Setup for the Next Rally


  **Lee argues that March was always a weak month, but that’s changing.**


  Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin’s recent underperformance is seasonal—and potentially strategic for long-term buyers. “Bitcoin seasonally was just not going to be attractive until after March ends,” he said. Now, with the second quarter beginning, Lee suggests conditions are improving, creating a favorable setup for a significant rebound.


  Lee points to the broader macro calendar, including the end of quantitative tightening and easing measures by central banks. He sees “positive Washington tailwinds” and reduced pressure from tariff-related uncertainty, particularly under Trump’s policy agenda, as additional reasons for optimism.

  ### Macro and Political Tailwinds Boost the Bull Case


  **Fed shifts, political clarity, and regulatory changes could drive prices.**


  Lee remains confident that a friendlier macro environment will emerge in the months ahead. Easing from the Federal Reserve, along with clarity around U.S. trade and monetary policies, could serve as fuel for Bitcoin’s ascent. He also highlighted how legislative action on stablecoins could positively affect U.S. monetary strength and, indirectly, crypto asset growth.


  Referencing Larry Fink’s recent warning about U.S. protectionism weakening the dollar, Lee took a slightly different stance—arguing that **smart stablecoin regulation could preserve the dollar’s global influence**, especially in the rapidly growing crypto economy.

  ### Long-Term Entry Point: Lee’s Advice to Investors


  **The dip could be the buying opportunity bulls have been waiting for.**


  Lee believes the current correction is part of a broader pattern that mirrors past cycles. “I think now is a good time to be stacking Bitcoin,” he said. His message: don’t get shaken by near-term volatility. For long-term holders, April may mark the beginning of a stronger phase that builds toward new all-time highs.


  He also pointed out that Bitcoin’s historic post-halving rallies tend to occur in the latter half of the year. That timing, combined with structural demand from ETFs and institutional players, could propel Bitcoin well beyond the $100,000 mark by December.

  ### Bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar: Competing or Complementing?


  **Lee sees crypto as a tool to protect, not replace, dollar dominance.**


  While concerns about the weakening U.S. dollar have increased, Lee emphasizes that **crypto—especially stablecoins—can actually reinforce the dollar’s role** in global finance. With dollar-backed stablecoins already dominating on-chain payments, Lee argues that regulatory frameworks could solidify this lead.


  His stance contrasts with those who see crypto as an adversary to fiat currencies. Instead, he views it as an ecosystem where the dollar remains king—if the U.S. plays its regulatory cards right.

  ### Looking Ahead: All Eyes on April and Beyond


  **From $80K lows to $150K highs? The second half of 2025 holds the key.**


  As April begins, Bitcoin sits at a critical crossroads. Tom Lee’s $150,000 target may seem ambitious amid current volatility, but his thesis is grounded in both seasonal trends and structural macro shifts. Whether the crypto market follows his trajectory remains to be seen—but the next few months will be pivotal.


  Investors betting on a second-half surge will be watching the Fed, Capitol Hill, and global adoption trends closely. According to Lee, the worst may already be behind us—and the next rally could surprise even the most seasoned traders.
