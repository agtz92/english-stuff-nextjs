  finance ecosystem by integrating Chainlink’s technology to scale tokenized
  fund offerings. Through this partnership, Libre aims to bring real-world
  investment products from major firms like BlackRock and Laser Digital onto
  blockchain rails with enhanced transparency, interoperability, and automation.

  ### Chainlink at the Core of Libre’s Tokenized Infrastructure


  **Using NAVLink, SmartData, and Proof of Reserve for fund validation**


  On April 8, Libre Capital announced that it will leverage several Chainlink tools — including the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), SmartData, and NAVLink — to enhance its fund issuance framework. These tools are designed to ensure asset validation, pricing accuracy, and transparent reserve verification across networks.


  Libre’s tokenized fund suite includes exposure to traditional asset managers like BlackRock, Brevan Howard, and Hamilton Lane, as well as crypto-native firms such as Laser Digital, the digital asset division of Japan’s Nomura Group.


  Chainlink’s standards are now being used not just for data feeds, but also to drive fund distribution and real-time Net Asset Value (NAV) tracking across decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

  ### A Booming Market for On-Chain Real World Assets (RWA)


  **Libre expands across Injective, LayerZero, and Chainlink for scale**


  Earlier in 2025, Libre deployed its fund issuance infrastructure on the Injective blockchain, opening access to hedge funds, private credit, and money market strategies for accredited investors. Its recent partnership with LayerZero extends interoperability to over 120 blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Aptos.


  Now with Chainlink’s framework integrated, Libre can securely distribute tokenized assets while maintaining transparent, auditable on-chain reserves. For DeFi developers, this opens new opportunities to build yield strategies, insurance products, and risk-managed portfolios based on verifiable fund performance.


  Libre’s rapid expansion places it among the most connected players in the RWA tokenization space — linking major TradFi names to web3 rails.

  ### Why Chainlink Matters for Institutional Fund Tokenization


  **Automation, data integrity, and DeFi access come together**


  The combination of Chainlink’s NAVLink and SmartData enables automated risk analysis and financial data integrity, both crucial for asset managers seeking on-chain exposure. With tokenized funds backed by verified real-world data, DeFi protocols can confidently integrate these products into smart contracts for lending, collateralization, or structured products.


  Proof of Reserve adds an additional layer of transparency by ensuring that the on-chain assets correspond to real-world investments held in custody. For institutions, these assurances are critical for compliance and investor confidence.


  Libre Capital’s strategy now combines infrastructure, data, and integrations across multiple layers — from custody and reserve proof to decentralized access and cross-chain functionality.

  ### Real Assets, Real Momentum


  **What this means for the future of decentralized finance**


  The partnership with Chainlink underscores a major trend: the blending of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized protocols. Libre is not just issuing synthetic versions of funds — it is creating tokenized representations of real exposure to regulated investment vehicles, using verifiable data and standardized logic to bridge on-chain and off-chain finance.


  As tokenized funds become more accessible and standardized, platforms like Libre may serve as the backbone for next-generation asset management — where NAV is updated on-chain in real time, custody is verifiable by smart contract, and liquidity spans across networks via interoperability protocols.
