short-description: Argentine President Javier Milei has rejected allegations
  that he promoted the LIBRA memecoin, which recently crashed in a classic
  pump-and-dump scheme, leaving thousands of investors with significant losses.
  While he acknowledges mentioning the token, Milei insists he never encouraged
  people to invest, calling the controversy a private financial issue rather
  than a government matter.

  ### **Milei’s Response to LIBRA Controversy**


  **President distances himself from accusations of financial misconduct**


  The controversy erupted after **tier10k** reported on X that Milei had publicly spoken about LIBRA before its **rapid price surge** and **subsequent collapse**. However, Milei argues that his involvement was limited to **sharing information** and that the impact on Argentina was minimal.


  “I only mentioned the token; I never asked anyone to invest in it,” Milei stated, downplaying the issue by claiming that only **four or five Argentine investors** were affected, with most traders being from **China and the U.S.**


  Contrary to reports suggesting that **44,000 investors** suffered losses, Milei claims the actual number is closer to **5,000**, primarily **experienced traders** who understood the risks. He maintains that the LIBRA scandal is a **personal financial matter** and not a **governmental crisis**.

  ### **Hayden Davis’ Role in LIBRA and Milei’s Connection**


  **LIBRA’s creator envisioned financial accessibility, says Milei**


  Milei further clarified that **Hayden Davis**, one of LIBRA’s key figures, had pitched the token as a **way to provide funding to entrepreneurs** struggling in Argentina’s informal economy. According to Milei, he **simply helped spread the word**, believing the initiative could be beneficial.


  Despite defending his stance, Milei admitted that the controversy has taught him a lesson about **political perception and accessibility**.


  “I acted in good faith, but I realize now that as president, I need to **raise my filters** and avoid being so accessible,” he said, acknowledging the **political backlash** that followed.
