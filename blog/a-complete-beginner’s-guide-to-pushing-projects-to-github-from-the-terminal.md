  ### **What does it mean to push to GitHub?**


  **Pushing your files or changes to GitHub means syncing your local work to the cloud.**


  When developers say they're “pushing to GitHub,” they mean uploading files from their local computer to a remote repository hosted on GitHub. This allows you to store backups of your work, collaborate with others, and track progress over time.


  Let’s say you’ve just finished a new project or made updates to an existing one. To share your changes, you push them to GitHub. This uploads your files to the cloud, making them accessible to your team—or to the public if your repository is open.

  ### **How to push to GitHub step by step**


  **A simple workflow to send your files from your local machine to GitHub.**


  Before you start, make sure Git is installed and configured on your system. Here’s a straightforward guide to push code:


  1. Go to your GitHub repository and copy the repository URL.

  2. Open your terminal or Git Bash.

  3. Navigate to your local project folder using `cd [folder_name]`.

  4. Clone the GitHub repository with:\
     `git clone [URL]`
  5. Enter the repo directory with:\
     `cd [repo_name]`
  6. Add or edit files as needed.

  7. Stage your changes with:\
     `git add .`
  8. Commit your changes with:\
     `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
  9. Push the changes to GitHub with:\
     `git push origin [branch_name]`

  If it’s your first time pushing to GitHub from this terminal, you may be prompted to log in. Once authenticated, your files will be uploaded.


  Check your GitHub repo online to verify everything worked—your files should now be live.

  ### **Common mistakes when pushing and how to avoid them**


  **Avoid typical errors like branch mismatches or forgotten files.**


  Even though the push process is simple, it’s easy to make mistakes:


  * **Forgetting to stage files:** If you skip `git add .`, nothing gets committed. Use `git status` to check what’s being tracked.

  * **Branch confusion:** If you cloned the `main` branch but try to push to `master`, you’ll get an error. Use `git branch` to verify the branch name before pushing.

  * **Authentication issues:** GitHub now uses personal access tokens instead of passwords. Make sure you’ve created one and are using it if prompted.


  Fixing these errors is part of becoming a better developer. They’re frustrating at first—but once resolved, pushing becomes second nature.

  ### **Automate GitHub with Zapier**


  **Save time by connecting GitHub to other tools for notifications, tasks, and more.**


  Once you're comfortable with manual pushes, automation tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com) can help you streamline repetitive tasks.


  Here are a few ways to automate your GitHub workflow:


  * Notify your Slack channel when a new commit is pushed.

  * Create a Trello card when a new pull request is opened.

  * Send an email summary when changes are made to your repo.


  Zapier requires no coding—just connect your apps, set up a few rules, and let it run in the background while you focus on development.
