  ### Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization


  **Blending physical assets with blockchain technology**


  BounceBit’s partnership with Ondo Finance focuses on real-world asset tokenization, a process that transforms ownership of physical or financial assets into blockchain-based digital tokens. This approach makes assets like real estate, bonds, and commodities more accessible and manageable in a decentralized framework.


  By combining blockchain efficiency with tangible asset backing, this collaboration aims to offer institutional-grade yield opportunities that redefine traditional finance.

  ### Ondo Finance’s Contributions


  **Tokenized Treasuries and a $600 million ecosystem**


  Ondo Finance, renowned for its tokenized U.S. Treasuries, brings substantial value to BounceBit’s ecosystem with over $600 million in total value locked across various blockchains. The integration includes the USDY vault, supported by U.S. Treasuries, which offers non-U.S. users variable interest rates and daily liquidity.


  This collaboration aligns with Ondo's recent ventures, such as its partnership with Wellington Management, to enhance liquidity for tokenized Treasury Funds, bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance.
