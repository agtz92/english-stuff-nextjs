short-description: Carl Weathers, star of Disney+'s The Mandalorian and the
  actor that played Apollo Creed in Rocky IV says he begins filming for season 3
  tomorrow.

  In 2021, The Mandalorian is gone for an entire year. Luckily we have all of
  its amazing content from 2019 and 2020 to tide us over until 2022 when another
  season premieres!


  The long pause is assured by Robert Rodriguez's The Book of Boba Fett spinoff series, which will release at the end of December. Details are scarce due to Lucasfilm's trademark commitment to secrecy.

  Carl Weathers "Greef Karga"confirmed the begining of filiming The Mandalorian
  Season 3 with a tweet:


  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mandalorian, season #3 begins for Yours Truly, on tomorrow. Greef Karga will be back on Disney+. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BePeace?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BePeace</a></p>&mdash; Carl Weathers (@TheCarlWeathers) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCarlWeathers/status/1448055910257942533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

  Since the appearance of a dear Star Wars character (NO, we are not spoiling
  the season finale just in case you haven't already finished it) we have been
  waiting for Grogu's comeback to the TV screen.

  Lucasfilm is really hyping up their upcoming series, "The Book of Boba Fett",
  so it seems like they're not too worried about the show slowing down
  production. Weathers himself confirmed that season three will be happening in
  time for next year's release!




  With Cara Dune out of the picture, it makes sense that Karga would have a more substantial role in The Mandalorian moving forward given his close association with her on planet Nevarro.

  The Mandalorian season 3 isn't set to release for another year, but it's
  possible that Weathers may reprise his role sooner than that. Recent reports
  claim The Book of Boba Fett is nearly a prologue given the overlapping story
  threads and familiar faces; one can only hope Robert Rodriguez will be able
  take us back into this world - even if just for its second half-season!
