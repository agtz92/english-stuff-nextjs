  ### **Czech Republic’s Bold Bitcoin Move**

  ### **Where Does the U.S. Stand on a Bitcoin Reserve?**


  The **U.S. is considering multiple models** for a national Bitcoin reserve. President **Donald Trump** has backed the idea of **stockpiling seized BTC** and **not selling it**. Meanwhile, **Senator Cynthia Lummis** has proposed a **1-million BTC acquisition over five years**, with holdings locked for **20 years**.

  Meanwhile, **states like Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania** are pushing for their own **state-level Bitcoin reserves**, with Pennsylvania proposing a **10% budget allocation for BTC purchases**.
