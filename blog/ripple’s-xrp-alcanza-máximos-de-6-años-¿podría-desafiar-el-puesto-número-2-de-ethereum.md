  **Stability and accessibility for users and businesses**


  Ripple is preparing to launch RLUSD, a stablecoin backed by NYDFS approval and designed to compete with USDC and USDT. This move could reduce XRP's circulating supply, create scarcity, and increase the XRP Ledger’s appeal to developers and institutions.
