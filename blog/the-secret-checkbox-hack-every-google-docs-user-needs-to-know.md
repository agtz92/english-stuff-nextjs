  ### Quick Ways to Insert Checkboxes in Google Docs


  **Three simple methods to add checkboxes to your documents, fast.**


  If you're in a rush to create a checklist, Google Docs has made it easier than ever. The fastest method is the keyboard shortcut: just type two square brackets `[]` and hit the space bar. A checkbox instantly appears. Press Enter, and another one pops up on the next line—ready for your next item.


  Alternatively, you can use the Format menu. Highlight your list, click **Format > Bullets & numbering > Checklist**, and choose your preferred style. You’ll get an option to use a checkbox with or without strikethrough when marked.


  The third method is to click the **Checklist button** in the toolbar. It's located right next to the bulleted list button. If you don’t see it, click the three-dot **More** menu to reveal it. Clicking the small arrow next to the icon gives you formatting choices, making it a great option when visual style matters.


  These methods work on both blank documents and existing lists, letting you toggle between regular text and interactive tasks in seconds.

  ### Using Google Docs Checkboxes on Mobile


  **Checkboxes work great on smartphones too—here’s how to add them.**


  You don’t need to be on a desktop to enjoy the checkbox magic. On mobile devices, Google Docs supports checklists just as smoothly. The quickest trick? Type `[]` and tap the space bar—it automatically converts into a clickable checkbox.


  For a more visual method, open the mobile app and highlight your list. Then tap the **bulleted list icon** to expand formatting tools, and select the **checklist icon** from the menu. Your plain text instantly becomes a checklist with tappable boxes.


  This feature is especially useful when you're on the go. Whether you're adding items to a grocery list or updating project notes during a meeting, checkboxes make tracking progress effortless—even from your phone.

  ### Assign Checkboxes as Google Tasks (For Paid Users)


  **Turn checklists into dynamic, trackable Google Tasks with due dates and assignees.**


  If you're on a Google Workspace plan, you can take checkbox functionality even further by linking them to Google Tasks. Just hover to the left of any checkbox and click the **Assign as a task** button. From there, you can assign it to yourself or a teammate and even set a due date.


  Once assigned, each checkbox becomes a fully integrated task with a mini preview window that includes the assignee, deadline, and status. This is a game-changer for teams working collaboratively in shared Docs. It keeps everyone aligned on responsibilities without leaving the document.


  Even better, each task links directly back to its location in the Google Doc. So you can track your tasks in the Google Tasks sidebar or app and jump straight into the relevant document context with a single click.

  ### Automate Checklists in Google Docs With AI Tools


  **Use Zapier and ChatGPT to automatically generate and populate checklists across your docs.**


  Checkboxes are a powerful manual tool—but when combined with automation platforms like Zapier and AI like ChatGPT, they become supercharged.


  For instance, you can build a Zap that takes responses from a Typeform survey or CRM entry and turns them into a checklist in Google Docs automatically. Or you can use AI to summarize a Zoom meeting and auto-create a task list with clickable checkboxes, complete with assignments and deadlines.


  Other popular automations include:


  * **Autopopulating templates**: When a new deal is entered in Salesforce, create a proposal doc with a task list.

  * **Meeting follow-ups**: After a meeting ends, use ChatGPT to summarize discussion points and auto-generate a checklist in Google Docs.

  * **Task tracking**: Create dynamic checklists from new calendar events, to-do list entries, or even Slack messages.


  These integrations let you skip repetitive manual work and focus on getting things done. And since Zapier connects with over 8,000 apps, there’s no shortage of workflow possibilities.
