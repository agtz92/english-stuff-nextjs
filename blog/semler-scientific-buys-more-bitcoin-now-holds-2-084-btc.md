  ### Leveraging the ATM Program


  **Capital raising through equity sales**


  Since August 2024, Semler has raised approximately $100 million through its ATM offering, facilitated by Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. The company has also filed a second prospectus supplement to its S-3 Shelf Registration, aiming to offer an additional $50 million in shares. This will increase the total amount offered under the ATM program to $150 million.

  ### Expanding Beyond Healthcare Tech


  **A bold diversification strategy**


  While Semler operates in the healthcare technology sector, its continued investment in Bitcoin demonstrates a forward-looking approach to asset diversification. The company’s Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement has provided it with the capital flexibility needed to fund these crypto acquisitions.
