  1. Drill holes in each corner of the board for the suspension wires using a **2.5 mm wood drill bit**.

  2. Drill the marked circles for the pots using an **18 mm wood drill bit** to create pilot holes for the jigsaw.


  #### **Tips for Drilling**

  **Securely suspend the rack from your ceiling**

  4. Attach the cables to the ceiling hooks, ensuring the rack hangs evenly.


  #### **Tips for Choosing the Right Drill Bit**


  * Knock on your ceiling to determine its material (hollow sound indicates plaster; dull sound indicates concrete).

  * Consult your local hardware store for the appropriate drill bit and tool.
