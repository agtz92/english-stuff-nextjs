  ### Missouri’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Fund


  **A hedge against inflation and financial diversification**\

  Proposed by **Representative Ben Keathley**, House Bill 1217 would **empower the state treasurer** to **invest in and hold Bitcoin**, positioning it as a **hedge against inflation** and a means to **diversify Missouri’s financial holdings**. The bill states that the treasurer could **acquire Bitcoin through investments, gifts, or donations** from **government entities and residents**.

  ### Crypto Payments for Taxes and Fees


  **Missouri moves toward broader crypto adoption**\

  One of the **most ambitious provisions** in the bill mandates that **state and local government agencies must accept cryptocurrency** for **taxes, fees, and fines**. However, those making crypto payments would be required to **cover transaction costs** associated with these digital transactions.


  Additionally, Bitcoin **acquired under this legislation** would need to be **held for a minimum of five years**, ensuring a long-term approach to its strategic value.

  ### The Growing Trend of State-Level Bitcoin Adoption


  **Missouri follows in the footsteps of other crypto-friendly states**\

  Missouri is not alone in its push toward **state-backed Bitcoin reserves**. **Utah is advancing House Bill 230**, which would allow its treasurer to invest **up to 5% of certain public funds in digital assets**. Across the U.S., at least **16 states**, including **Ohio, Wyoming, and New Hampshire**, are considering **similar initiatives** aimed at integrating Bitcoin into state financial strategies.
