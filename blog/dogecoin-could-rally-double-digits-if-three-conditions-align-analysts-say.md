short-description: >-
  Dogecoin has shown surprising strength this week, surging nearly 10% even as
  most altcoins struggled amid renewed macroeconomic tensions, including
  President Donald Trump’s tariff policy announcements. Trading above $0.2058
  for the first time in two weeks, DOGE could be on track for an additional 11%
  climb if market conditions remain favorable.


  Technical indicators, on-chain metrics, and derivative trends all point toward a potential breakout. Analysts believe that if three key signals—technical momentum, network activity, and derivative positioning—continue aligning, Dogecoin could reach resistance levels near $0.24040, representing nearly 24% upside from current prices.

  ### Technical Signals Flash Bullish Momentum


  **DOGE shows signs of trend continuation on price chart**


  Dogecoin hit a short-term peak at **$0.20585** on March 26, outperforming peers affected by broader market volatility. The **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** sits at 52, indicating moderate bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the **MACD** shows green histogram bars above the neutral line, reinforcing a positive price outlook.


  The next resistance level lies within an **imbalance zone** between $0.21465 and $0.24040. A decisive breakout above $0.21465 could propel DOGE to the upper boundary of that zone, with price action supported by growing demand and improved sentiment.

  ### On-Chain Metrics Support Continued Growth


  **Holder activity and profit-taking trends show strength**


  On-chain data reveals that the number of **DOGE holders** continues to grow steadily, a sign of retail and institutional interest. **Network Realized Profit/Loss** remains modest, suggesting that large-scale profit-taking has not yet triggered downward pressure.


  Active address count has held steady since mid-March, further supporting the meme coin’s resilience. Wallets holding **1 million to 10 million DOGE** have been accumulating since March 10, even as the price climbs—indicating growing confidence among mid-tier holders.

  ### Derivatives Traders Bet on More Upside


  **Open interest and long/short ratio signal bullish sentiment**


  Open interest in Dogecoin derivatives has rebounded to **$1.98 billion**, recovering from lows earlier this month. The **long/short ratio** on major exchanges like Binance and OKX is above 1, showing traders are positioning for a price increase.


  Liquidations totaled **$4.29 million in long positions** on March 27, but with the price stabilizing and OI rising, this may attract new entries from sidelined traders. If spot prices follow derivatives sentiment, a retest of **$0.21465** is likely.

  ### ETF Speculation and Macro Catalysts in Play


  **Institutional narratives and regulatory shifts could fuel price action**


  One key catalyst is the **pending Dogecoin ETF** filing from Bitwise. If approved, it could elevate DOGE’s status among institutional investors. Broader regulatory developments, including a potential **stablecoin bill in Congress**, could also increase investor confidence.


  In addition, Dogecoin has shown resilience during Bitcoin flash crashes—often recovering faster than other altcoins. Continued interest from **whales and large wallets** offers another layer of support for the bullish thesis in the coming weeks.
