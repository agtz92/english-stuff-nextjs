  ### Weiss Sells Another 10% of His Bitcoin Position


  Speaking on CNBC’s **"Halftime Report,"** Weiss revealed that he **reduced his Bitcoin exposure by an additional 10%**, following a **20% sell-off last week**. While the exact size of his Bitcoin position remains unclear, he previously referred to it as a **“positive trade.”**


  His **Bitcoin exposure is through BlackRock’s spot ETF**, highlighting how institutional products are increasingly being used by major investors to manage crypto holdings.

  ### Market Conditions Drive Cautious Trading


  Weiss pointed to **macroeconomic concerns**, including:


  * **U.S. trade wars and tariffs** under the Trump administration

  * **Regulatory uncertainty** surrounding crypto in the U.S.

  * **Bitcoin’s prolonged consolidation** within a set price range


  He noted that Bitcoin remains a **risk asset**, stating:


  *"Bitcoin goes through these consolidation periods, and I think this could be one of them until we get specific laws and regulations from the new head of the SEC."*


  The **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**, under acting chair **Mark Uyeda**, has taken steps to **clarify crypto regulations**, launching a **Crypto Task Force** and overhauling its **crypto crime-fighting unit**. Additionally, the SEC has **dropped litigation** against **Coinbase, OpenSea, and Robinhood**, signaling a shift in regulatory stance.

  * **Resistance:** $100,000

  * **Support:** $94,000

  * **Projected range:** $92,000 - $105,000
