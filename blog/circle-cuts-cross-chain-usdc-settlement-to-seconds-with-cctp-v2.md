  “Traditional cross-chain flows are often riddled with **trust assumptions,
  block-finality delays, and liquidity fragmentation**,” said **Jonathan Lim**,
  Principal Product Manager at Circle. **“CCTP v2 mitigates these issues and
  enhances cross-chain infrastructure for crypto capital markets.”**
