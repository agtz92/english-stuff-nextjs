  ### Whales Drive the Crash


  **Massive profit-taking hits TRUMP token**\

  The Official Trump token dropped to $38.50, a steep decline from its recent peak. This sell-off has reduced the coin's market valuation to approximately $7.6 billion. Data from Nansen reveals that the most profitable whales have sold most or all of their holdings:


  * The top wallet made $57 million in profit and still holds unrealized gains of $13 million, indicating expectations of a recovery.

  * The second-largest wallet earned $53 million but has completely exited its position.

  * Another wallet profited $34 million and has sold 84% of its tokens.

  **Following a familiar trajectory**\

  The sharp decline of the Official Trump token reflects a common pattern for meme coins: an initial surge fueled by FOMO (fear of missing out), followed by a dramatic crash. This trend has been seen in other tokens, such as:


  * **Popcat**: Peaked at $2.10 in 2024 before crashing by 78%.

  * **Kekius Maximus**: Dropped 92% after Elon Musk's brief endorsement.

  * **Shiba Inu and Dogecoin**: Both remain significantly below their all-time highs.

  ### Legal Risks for Meme Coin Promoters


  **Potential lawsuits on the horizon**\

  The ongoing crash of the Trump tokens could expose promoters to legal risks. Crypto endorsers have faced lawsuits for token crashes in the past, as seen with Hawk Tuah Girlâ€™s $HAWK meme coin. If retail investors allege fraud or manipulation, the Trump tokens could become the subject of similar legal action.
