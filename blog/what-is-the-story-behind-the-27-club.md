short-description: It's no secret that a lot of musicians die young. But why is
  it that so many of them seem to die at age 27? Is it just a coincidence, or is
  there something more sinister at work?

  ## What is the story behind the 27 Club?


  The first documented case of the "27 Club" was that of blues singer Robert Johnson, who died in 1938 under mysterious circumstances. Johnson was a hugely influential figure in the world of music, and his untimely death only added to his legend. In the ensuing years, an alarming number of other famous musicians would also die at age 27, including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse. <br>


  Robert Johnson was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi, in 1911. He grew up in a poor family and received very little formal education. As a young man, he worked as a sharecropper and learned to play the guitar. Johnson began performing at local juke joints and quickly gained a reputation as a talented musician. He soon began touring the Mississippi Delta region with other blues musicians. <br>

  In 1936, Johnson went to San Antonio, Texas, to record his first songs for the
  American Record Corporation. He recorded two songs, "Terraplane Blues" and
  "Sweet Home Chicago", which were both released as 7-inch singles. These two
  recordings would later become some of Johnson's most famous songs. <br>


  A few months after recording his first songs, Johnson returned to Mississippi. It was there that he met Don Robey, the owner of Peacock Records. Robey offered to record Johnson again, but the sessions were unsuccessful. However, Robey did agree to release two of Johnson's previously recorded songs, "Hellhound on My Trail" and "Me and the Devil Blues". <br>

  ## The Legend of Robert Johnson


  There are many stories about Robert Johnson and how he supposedly sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical talent. One story says that Johnson met the devil at a crossroads in Mississippi one night and made a deal with him. The devil tuned Johnson's guitar for him three times before vanishing into the darkness. <br>


  Unfortunately, we know much more about how Robert Johnson died than we do about how he lived. What we do know is that he died at the age of 27 after being poisoned by a jealous husband. Some say that it was the Devil who come to collect on Johnson's deal, but whatever the cause, Robert Johnson's death marked the end of extraordinary talent. <br>
