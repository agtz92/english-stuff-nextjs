  **James A. Murphy demands internal documents that could identify Bitcoin’s creator**


  James A. Murphy, also known online as “MetaLawMan,” has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), citing the agency’s failure to respond to previous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The case, filed in a Washington D.C. District Court, seeks emails, meeting notes, and any documents related to a 2019 conference where DHS agents allegedly met with four individuals believed to be behind the Bitcoin project.

  ### The 2019 DHS Revelation


  **A special agent claimed the U.S. had already found Satoshi—years ago**


  According to statements made in 2019 by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud, the agency not only identified but also interviewed a group of four people suspected to be behind Bitcoin. The revelation, largely overlooked at the time, suggested that federal agents had direct communication with the individuals responsible for creating the cryptocurrency. Murphy's lawsuit now brings this claim back into the spotlight, demanding transparency.

  ### Why This Matters Now


  **Political pressure and billions invested increase the urgency**


  Murphy argues that uncovering Satoshi’s identity is more critical than ever. With billions of dollars now tied up in Bitcoin ETFs and an executive order from Donald Trump calling for a strategic Bitcoin reserve using forfeited assets, the legal and financial implications are immense. The case also touches on issues of national security and economic sovereignty.

  ### A Decade-Old Mystery That Refuses to Die


  **Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity has long been the crypto world’s biggest enigma**


  Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared shortly after launching Bitcoin in 2009, leaving behind a white paper, an open-source protocol, and endless speculation. Theories about Nakamoto’s identity range from tech entrepreneurs to foreign governments, but none have been conclusively proven. Murphy’s lawsuit could be the first step toward real answers.

  ### DHS Silent As Case Gains Momentum


  **Government refusal to comment fuels speculation**


  Despite repeated requests for comment, the DHS has remained silent. Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Field, now representing Murphy, is confident the lawsuit will force a response. If successful, the case could unveil unprecedented details about the early days of Bitcoin and possibly confirm long-suspected truths.
