  **Brad Garlinghouse's "slow weekend" tweet fueled online debates**\

  ### **Market crash: Reasons beyond the tweet**


  **Global tensions and liquidations contributed to the downfall**\

  The Jan. 26 crash wasn’t solely about Garlinghouse’s tweet. Among the factors were new tariffs proposed by Donald Trump, China’s AI advancements with DeepSeek, and a massive $800M in crypto liquidations within 24 hours. Additionally, Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry at the end of the month caused further uncertainty.

  **The roots of the XRP vs Bitcoin feud**\

  Since XRP emerged in 2017 as a leader in crypto banking solutions, Bitcoin maximalists have targeted its centralization and reliance on corporate partnerships. Ripple’s strategy to sell XRP for operational sustainability remains a sore point, contrasting Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos and absence of a dev-controlled supply.
