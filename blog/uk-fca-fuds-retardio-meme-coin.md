  ### FCA’s Warning: What It Means for Investors


  **Financial restrictions and investor exclusions**


  The FCA’s notice, released on December 16, highlighted that Retardio may be offering or promoting financial services without proper regulatory permissions. This development disqualifies its investors from accessing the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.


  The FCA clarified:\

  “This means it’s unlikely you’d get your money back if the firm goes out of business.”


  This warning follows similar actions taken earlier in December against other projects, such as Pump.fun, a meme coin launchpad.

  ### The Bigger Picture: FCA’s Increasing Crypto Scrutiny


  **Regulatory crackdowns intensify in the UK**


  The FCA is ramping up its efforts to tighten crypto regulations, proposing new restrictions on unregulated firms offering crypto services. This builds on the 2023 ban on digital asset promotions targeting UK investors.


  The regulator’s plans are part of a broader push to implement stricter crypto regulations by 2025, encompassing stablecoins and staking.

  ### Experts Weigh In


  **Calls for standardized frameworks amid global shifts**


  Thought leaders, such as Brett Hillis from On Chain, stress the importance of Britain standardizing its digital asset regulations, especially in light of international changes like Donald Trump’s re-election.


  Interestingly, the UK government currently holds over $6 billion worth of Bitcoin, primarily from criminal seizures. This adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing regulatory discussions.
