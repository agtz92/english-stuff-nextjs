  While the global regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies continues to
  evolve, crypto’s role in money laundering remains persistent and
  sophisticated. A recent analysis of the Bybit hack illustrates how crypto
  mixers and cross-chain bridges are increasingly being used to conceal illicit
  funds, despite technological advances in blockchain tracing.


  Bybit CEO Ben Zhou revealed that 88% of the stolen assets in the February 2025 hack are still traceable, but over 7.5% have “gone dark” — a troubling sign that obfuscation tools are still effective. Zhou pointed to Tornado Cash, Wasabi, Railgun, and Crypto Mixer as the primary platforms used for laundering the stolen assets, most of which were eventually funneled through peer-to-peer channels.

  ### The Bybit Hack: A Case Study in Modern Crypto Laundering


  **Anatomy of a High-Stakes Operation**


  Zhou urged the community to help decode mixer transactions, calling it the “number one challenge” in recovering stolen funds. Blockchain forensics firm Elliptic linked the Bybit hack to the **Lazarus Group**, a notorious North Korean hacking syndicate that may have used the theft to fund Pyongyang’s nuclear program.


  Arkham Analytics tracked 12.9 BTC from the stolen funds to an unknown address on March 20, further emphasizing the complexity of tracing stolen crypto after it’s been laundered through multiple layers.

  ### Laundering Trends: Peaks, Drops, and Professionalization


  **From Pandemic Boom to Institutional Challenge**


  Crypto-based money laundering surged in 2022, reaching $31.5 billion — nearly double 2021’s $18.3 billion and triple the 2019 average. Though this figure declined to $22.2 billion in 2023, it still dwarfs pre-2021 levels. Chainalysis data shows that even with a 15% drop in total crypto volume, laundering operations remain stubbornly high.


  The criminal use of crypto has remained steady at around **$50 billion annually** since 2022, indicating a plateau rather than a decline. Experts suggest the ecosystem has become more **diverse and professional**, with hackers deploying a blend of mixers, decentralized exchanges, and off-ramp services.

  ### The Toolmaker Debate: Innovation or Enabler?


  **Crypto’s Civil Liberties Battle Over Privacy Tools**


  While prosecutors aim to hold developers of privacy tools accountable, the crypto community continues to argue that building open-source, privacy-focused tools is not inherently criminal. Prominent cases like Tornado Cash’s Roman Storm and Samourai Wallet’s founders have sparked intense debates about technological neutrality and legal overreach.


  Crypto lawyer Marta Belcher drew a powerful analogy: “We don’t blame Ford when a car is used in a bank robbery.” Still, in 2025, courts are leaning toward penalizing developers, with Samourai Wallet’s founders facing up to 25 years in prison.

  ### Mixer Use Declines, But Bridges Rise

  **Evasion Tactics Evolve With Regulation**

  * Mixer use peaked in 2022, then declined due to law enforcement action
  * Cross-chain bridge usage has increased, making tracing harder
  * P2P transactions play a larger role in laundering flows
  * Developers now face legal action for enabling these tools

### The Future of Crypto and Compliance

**Between Decentralization and Regulation**

As crypto becomes more regulated, the tension between privacy and compliance continues to grow. Tools once hailed as innovations are now at the center of legal and ethical battles. While law enforcement improves its blockchain analysis capabilities, criminals are adapting with more intricate laundering techniques.

The next few years may decide whether crypto becomes fully integrated into traditional finance — or remains a battleground between privacy advocates and regulatory authorities.
