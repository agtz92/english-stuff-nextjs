short-description: The Dogwifhat Las Vegas Sphere project is facing growing
  criticism as nearly $700,000 in donations remain unused, sparking concerns
  over transparency and accountability. Despite surpassing its $650,000 goal,

  ### Rising Scrutiny Over Inactivity


  **Ten months later, donors question the project's progress.**\

  Crypto influencers led by Zion Thomas (Ansem) raised enough funds by March 2024 but have provided minimal updates. The last known communication was a vague joke in July, leaving donors frustrated and skeptical about the project's future.

  ### Frozen Funds Fuel Distrust


  **$700,000 in USDC sits untouched.**\

  The lack of transparency around the funds, still held in a crypto wallet, has led to demands for accountability. Critics on social media are calling for refunds or at least the utilization of the capital, further escalating the controversy.

  ### Dogwifhat Coin Takes a Hit


  **Market confidence shakes as WIF drops 45% in a month.**\

  The uncertainty surrounding the project has contributed to Dogwifhat’s meme coin losing nearly half its value in recent weeks. Investors are increasingly wary as doubts about the project’s legitimacy grow.

  ### What’s Next for the Project?


  **Pressure mounts for answers and action.**\

  Without clear updates, the project's credibility continues to erode. Whether the influencers will fulfill their promise or return the funds remains uncertain, leaving the future of the campaign—and the coin—in jeopardy.
