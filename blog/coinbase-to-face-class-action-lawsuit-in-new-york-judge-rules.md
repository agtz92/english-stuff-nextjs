short-description: A U.S. judge has ruled that Coinbase must face a class action
  lawsuit brought by customers in New York, marking a significant legal setback
  for the crypto exchange. The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase illegally sold
  securities and acted as a direct seller—a claim the exchange has strongly
  denied.

  ### Judge Rejects Coinbase’s Defense


  **Court rules Coinbase transacted directly with customers**\

  U.S. District Judge **Paul Engelmayer** ruled on **February 7, 2025**, that Coinbase’s argument—claiming it is **not a statutory seller under U.S. federal securities law**—does not hold. The judge emphasized that **customers transact directly with Coinbase**, reinforcing the plaintiffs’ claim that the exchange acted as a seller rather than a platform facilitating third-party transactions

  ### Case Revived After Previous Dismissal


  **Lawsuit gains momentum despite past setbacks**\

  This lawsuit is not new; it was initially dismissed by **Judge Engelmayer in February 2023**. However, in **April 2024**, the **2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan** reinstated parts of the case, allowing certain allegations to proceed. The latest ruling upholds those claims, ensuring that the class action lawsuit moves forward.

  ### Coinbase’s Response to Allegations


  **Exchange denies selling unregistered securities**\

  Coinbase has repeatedly denied the allegations, stating that it **does not list, offer, or sell securities**. The exchange has vowed to fight the lawsuit, aiming to dismiss additional claims. In a statement to **Reuters**, Coinbase reiterated its stance, asserting that **secondary sales of cryptocurrencies do not constitute securities transactions** under U.S. law.

  ### Additional Legal Challenges for Coinbase


  **Battles continue on multiple fronts**\

  Beyond this class action lawsuit, Coinbase is also facing a **separate legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**. The SEC sued the exchange in **June 2023**, accusing it of operating as an **unregistered securities exchange**. Additionally, in **May 2024**, a new lawsuit was filed by customers from **California and Florida**, again alleging that Coinbase’s crypto sales violated securities laws.
