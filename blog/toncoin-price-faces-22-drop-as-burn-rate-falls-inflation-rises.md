  ### **Rising Exchange Inflows & Weak Burn Rate**

  Over the past week, more than **240,000 TON tokens** have been moved to exchanges, indicating increased selling pressure. Simultaneously, the daily burn rate has dropped from **15,000 tokens** to just **5,805** on January 28. This decline means fewer coins are being removed from circulation, reducing the scarcity effect that supports price stability.

  Toncoin’s inflation rate has surged to **0.37%**, the highest level in nearly six months, further pressuring prices. Combined with reduced burning, this increase in circulating supply could accelerate TON’s downward trajectory.
