  ### Regulatory Tailwinds Under Trump Administration


  **Policy shifts favor corporate crypto investments**\

  Hougan believes the upcoming Trump administration will create a more favorable environment for corporate Bitcoin holdings. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs and evolving U.S. crypto regulations have reduced reputational risks, making Bitcoin more attractive to companies.

  ### Accounting Changes Boost Bitcoin's Corporate Appeal


  **New standards ease financial reporting for BTC**\

  The Financial Accounting Standards Board's ASU 2023-08 allows companies to report Bitcoin price increases, reversing previous rules that only accounted for declines. This change incentivizes more firms to integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets.
