short-description: Coinbase Institutional has open-sourced its multi-party
  computation (MPC) cryptography library in a bid to strengthen security
  standards across the cryptocurrency industry. The move comes amid a surge in
  crypto-related cyberattacks and aims to promote more secure transaction
  practices for developers and institutions alike.

  By making this advanced cryptographic toolkit public, Coinbase encourages the adoption of privacy-preserving and theft-resistant technology across the ecosystem. The GitHub release includes tools for secure key protection, transaction signing, and thorough documentation to support integration into third-party systems.

  ### What Is MPC and Why It Matters

  **Reduces single-point failure and strengthens private key security**


  MPC allows multiple parties to collectively sign transactions without exposing their individual private keys. This reduces the risk of internal theft, phishing, and external compromise by distributing trust and responsibility among several actors.


  Coinbase’s decision to open-source these tools is not only a technical milestone but a strategic one. It signals the company’s dedication to fostering an open, secure infrastructure for institutional-grade crypto custody and trading.

  ### Coinbase’s Security Track Record


  **Coinbase Prime hits $404B in assets under custody**


  Since launching in 2021, **Coinbase Prime** has emerged as a key player in institutional crypto services. The platform currently handles $364 billion in quarterly trading volume and supports 430+ assets for custody. Security remains the cornerstone of its business model as high-value clients demand reliability and safety.


  To reinforce this mission, Coinbase has paired the open-source launch with a **bug bounty program**. Security researchers are invited to analyze the code and report vulnerabilities, potentially earning rewards and contributing to a more robust industry standard.

  ### Alarming Rise in Crypto Hacks in Q1 2025


  **Over $1.6B stolen, centralized platforms hardest hit**


  Coinbase’s move comes at a critical time. According to **Immunefi’s Q1 2025 report**, the crypto sector experienced its worst quarter for hacks on record, with **$1.64 billion** stolen by attackers. A staggering **94% of those losses** occurred on centralized platforms.


  The **Bybit hack** alone resulted in **$1.53 billion** in losses, making it the largest exploit in the history of crypto. On-chain attacks focused heavily on **Ethereum** (15 incidents) and **BNB Chain** (19 incidents), highlighting vulnerabilities in smart contract infrastructures.

  ### An Industry-Wide Call to Action


  **Open collaboration may be the way forward**


  Only **$6.5 million** of the stolen funds from Q1 has been recovered—less than 0.5%. As threat actors become more sophisticated, traditional security models are proving inadequate. Open-source collaboration, like Coinbase’s MPC initiative, may represent a path forward by enabling global developers to test and improve foundational technologies.


  This release not only increases transparency but also levels the playing field for newer or smaller firms that lack access to advanced cryptographic tools. Industry stakeholders are already calling it a potential turning point in securing the digital asset landscape.
