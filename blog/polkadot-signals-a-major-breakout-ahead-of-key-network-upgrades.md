  **Double-bottom and falling wedge patterns signal bullish momentum.**\

  Polkadot's chart reveals a double-bottom formation at $6 and a falling wedge pattern—both bullish signals. Breaking above the 100-day moving average suggests that DOT could rally toward $11.65, a 60% increase from its current level.
