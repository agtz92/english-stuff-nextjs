  ### **What is a Prediction Market?**


  **Speculating outcomes through decentralized platforms**


  A prediction market is a financial marketplace where participants buy and sell contracts representing the likelihood of specific outcomes. These events can range from political elections to cryptocurrency price forecasts. Users trade based on their insights, creating a dynamic representation of crowd sentiment.


  For instance, platforms like **Polymarket** enable trading in events like Solana's price reaching an all-time high or political developments, turning the "wisdom of the crowd" into actionable predictions.

  ### **How Crypto Prediction Markets Work**


  **Contracts, trading models, and crowd-driven accuracy**


  Prediction markets function through the buying and selling of event-based contracts. Each contract corresponds to a specific outcome, with its price fluctuating based on user sentiment.


  Unlike traditional bookmakers, prediction markets allow continuous trading, enabling users to profit or minimize losses as new information arises. In crypto, decentralized models like **Augur** or hybrid models like **Polymarket** utilize smart contracts and blockchain for security and transparency.

  ### **Types of Crypto Prediction Markets**


  **Four distinct models for trading predictions**


  1. **Fixed Odds Betting**:\
     Odds are set by the platform, with no contract trading after the bet is placed.
  2. **Continuous Double Auction (CDA)**:\
     Users can trade contracts freely until the event concludes, creating opportunities for arbitrage and swing trading.
  3. **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**:\
     Liquidity and pricing are controlled by algorithms, ensuring decentralized operation.
  4. **Parimutuel Markets**:\
     Payouts are based on pooled bets, with winners sharing the final prize pool.
