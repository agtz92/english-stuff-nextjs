  The Crypto Task Force was announced in a memo by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on March 3. According to the document, the group includes representatives from multiple divisions within the SEC, along with staff from Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda’s office.


  Peirce emphasized that the task force consists of experienced professionals committed to addressing complex crypto regulatory issues. She also highlighted that the team will engage with other SEC experts and the public to develop practical and effective regulations.

  ### **A Shift in the SEC’s Crypto Oversight**


  The SEC’s approach to crypto regulation has undergone a significant transition in recent months. Under the previous administration, the agency aggressively pursued enforcement actions, imposing **$4.68 billion in fines on crypto firms in 2024 alone**, accounting for **68% of all penalties issued to the industry in SEC history**.


  However, a policy shift is becoming evident. The SEC has recently closed investigations into major crypto firms, including:


  * **Gemini**

  * **Coinbase**

  * **OpenSea**

  * **Uniswap Labs**

  * **Robinhood Crypto**

  * **Consensys**

  * **Kraken**


  This suggests a more measured regulatory stance, moving away from punitive enforcement toward structured engagement with the industry.
