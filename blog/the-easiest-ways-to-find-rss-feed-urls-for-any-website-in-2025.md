short-description: RSS may not dominate the web like it did a decade ago, but
  it’s still a powerhouse tool for staying informed. The problem? Finding RSS
  feeds in 2025 isn’t always straightforward. Most browsers don’t surface them,
  and many websites bury or omit RSS links altogether. But the good news is that
  with a few quick tricks—and some help from tools like Zapier—you can locate or
  even create RSS feeds for almost any site or app. At 3minread.com, we help you
  simplify tech and crypto news, and this guide is your shortcut to unlocking
  the power of RSS again.

  ### Start With the Basics: The Hidden Feed Endpoints


  **Most websites still have RSS feeds—you just need to know where to look.**


  Before diving into advanced techniques, try the simplest trick in the book: add `/feed` to the end of a site’s URL. For example:


  ```

  https://example.com/feed


  ```


  Surprisingly, this works on a wide variety of sites, especially if they’re powered by WordPress or other popular CMS platforms. If that doesn’t work, don’t give up—many major platforms have their own RSS patterns.


  Here are a few specific shortcuts:


  * **WordPress:** `example.com/feed`

  * **Medium:** `medium.com/feed/publication-name` or `example.medium.com/feed`

  * **Tumblr:** `example.tumblr.com/rss`

  * **Blogger:** `example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default`

  * **YouTube:** Just paste the channel URL into your RSS reader—it acts as the feed!


  It takes only a few seconds to test, and when it works, you’ll have instant updates from your favorite sources in your RSS reader of choice.

  ### Dig Into the Source Code for Hidden Feeds


  **When URL tricks fail, the website’s HTML usually has what you need.**


  If the site doesn’t follow conventional RSS patterns, it may still include a feed—just hidden in the page’s code.


  To find it:


  1. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose **View Page Source**.

  2. Use `Ctrl+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+F` (Mac) and search for:

     * `rss`
     * `atom`
     * `application/rss+xml`

  You’re looking for lines like this:


  ```

  <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="https://example.com/feed/" />


  ```


  Copy the `href` value and paste it into your RSS reader. Boom—you’ve got a working feed, even if it wasn’t visible on the page.

  ### Let Your RSS Reader Do the Heavy Lifting


  **Modern RSS readers are smart enough to detect feeds for you.**


  Before going full hacker mode, try this: paste the homepage URL into your RSS reader and let it scan for any feeds automatically. Many apps, including **Feedly**, **Inoreader**, and **The Old Reader**, will detect embedded RSS feeds in the background—even if they’re not advertised.


  In Feedly, for example, just click **Follow** and enter the website URL. If a feed exists, Feedly will find it. This method is ideal for users who want simplicity and speed.


  But what if the site genuinely *doesn’t* offer an RSS feed?

  ### Create Custom RSS Feeds With Zapier


  **No RSS feed? No problem. Zapier can create one for you.**


  Some sites or platforms simply don't support RSS. That’s where **Zapier’s RSS by Zapier** tool comes in. You can turn virtually any app, form, or content stream into a custom RSS feed with just a few clicks.


  Here are just a few examples:


  * **Reddit:** Create a feed for hot posts or keyword-matching comments.

  * **Google Calendar:** Get a feed of upcoming events.

  * **Google Sheets:** Turn new rows into feed items—great for team updates or project logs.

  * **Google Docs or Drive:** Auto-post new documents to an RSS feed.

  * **Slack, GitHub, or Facebook Pages:** Post new messages, notifications, or updates to a feed.


  You can even build a feed from **Instagram for Business**, which many tools no longer support directly via RSS.


  And best of all, once you've set up a Zap, you can pipe that feed to your reader—or trigger automations that email, archive, or even post that content elsewhere.

  ### Pro Tips to Get the Most From Your Feeds


  **Once you have your RSS feeds set up, here’s how to make them work harder for you.**


  * **Organize by topic:** Most RSS readers allow tagging or folders. Group your feeds by category—like news, crypto, productivity, or tech trends—for a smoother reading experience.

  * **Use filters:** Tools like Inoreader allow keyword filters, so you only see articles relevant to your interests.

  * **Set up alerts:** Combine RSS feeds with Zapier automations to get email or Slack alerts when certain keywords appear—great for brand monitoring, job searches, or crypto price movements.

  * **Turn RSS into a newsletter:** Want to share curated updates with your team or audience? Use your feed as a content source for weekly email digests.

  * **Archive your feeds:** Use tools like Notion, Pocket, or Google Sheets to save posts from your feed for later reference or analysis.


  Whether you're following breaking crypto news or monitoring your own content performance, RSS is still one of the most powerful—and underrated—tools for staying ahead.
