  ### Shardines: A New Era of Blockchain Scalability


  **Unlocking near-infinite horizontal scaling**


  On **February 5, 2025**, Aptos Labs announced **Shardines**, a new execution engine that enables **horizontal scalability** by **decoupling consensus from storage**. This architecture allows for **independent scaling**, unlocking unprecedented transaction speeds:


  * **1 million TPS for non-conflicting transactions**

  * **500,000+ TPS for conflicting transactions**


  Aptos Labs described this as **"near-linear throughput scaling,"** achieved on a **30-machine cluster**, demonstrating the potential for **infinitely scalable blockchain infrastructure**.

  ### Why Scalability Matters: The Future of Web3


  **A step toward mass adoption**


  The crypto industry has long sought solutions to improve execution speed and **reduce congestion on blockchain networks**. **Shardines is expected to accelerate Web3 growth** by allowing **higher transaction throughput**, making decentralized applications (dApps) **faster and more efficient**.


  The benefits extend across multiple sectors, including:


  * **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** – Enabling high-frequency trading and lending platforms.

  * **Gaming** – Powering on-chain economies with seamless microtransactions.

  * **Crypto Payments** – Reducing latency and improving cross-border transactions.

  * **On-Chain Global Markets** – Supporting large-scale decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and tokenized assets.

  ### Zaptos: Complementing Shardines for Sub-Second Finality


  **Building a next-gen blockchain ecosystem**


  In **January 2025**, Aptos Labs introduced **Zaptos**, a **high-performance transaction framework** designed to reduce **end-to-end latency**. Key features of Zaptos include:


  * **20,000 TPS** with sub-second finality.

  * **Enhanced efficiency for DeFi, gaming, and payments.**

  * **Seamless integration with existing blockchain ecosystems.**


  When combined with **Shardines**, **Zaptos** enhances **speed, scalability, and efficiency**, positioning **Aptos as one of the most advanced Layer 1 blockchains** in the market.
