  ### **XRP’s recent crash and doji candlestick formation**


  **Technical analysis suggests a reversal is on the horizon**\

  XRP fell over 21% to $2.65, marking its lowest point in 12 days. However, the formation of a long-legged **doji candlestick**—a pattern signaling potential reversals—at the $3 level could indicate a price rebound. A close above $3 at Monday’s trading session would strengthen this signal.

  ### **Bullish patterns support further upside**


  **Break-and-retest and bullish pennant patterns emerge**\

  XRP’s recent move to $2.6580 confirms a **break-and-retest pattern**, a classic continuation signal in trading. Additionally, a **bullish pennant pattern** observed in XRP charts suggests a possible climb to $12.15, as the measured distance from the pennant’s upper side aligns with the November-December flag pole.

  ### **Fundamental catalysts for XRP’s growth**


  **Regulatory wins and increasing demand drive optimism**\

  Ripple’s approval for money transmitter licenses in New York and Texas enables expanded financial services, fueling positive sentiment. XRP futures open interest has surged to $6 billion, up from November’s $650 million, reflecting strong demand. Moreover, the likelihood of a spot XRP ETF approval by the SEC—currently estimated at 73%—adds another bullish catalyst.
