short-description: Randy Guynn, a leading U.S. banking attorney, has advocated
  for bank-level regulation of stablecoins, arguing that issuers should maintain
  liquidity reserves and capital buffers similar to those required for banks.
  Speaking before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, Guynn highlighted
  the need for financial stability and consumer protection in the growing
  digital payments sector.

  ### Stablecoins as Digital Private Money


  **Proper oversight could enhance trust and financial stability**


  Guynn, chairman of the **Financial Institutions Group at Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP**, emphasized that **stablecoins function as digital private money** and should be regulated accordingly.


  Key points from his testimony:


  * **Stablecoins should maintain capital buffers** to ensure financial stability.

  * **Well-regulated stablecoins** can be as safe as insured bank deposits.

  * **Historical parallels** show that private money innovations have shaped financial systems.

  “If a payment stablecoin issuer has a properly calibrated reserve of liquid
  assets, capital buffer, and no material amount of other liabilities, payment
  stablecoins should be as safe as insured bank deposits and central bank
  money,” Guynn stated.

  ### Potential Risks Without Proper Oversight


  **Unregulated stablecoins could pose financial stability risks**


  Guynn warned that without **robust regulation**, stablecoins could introduce **systemic risks** similar to **past banking crises**. His concerns align with ongoing discussions around **the Stablecoin Regulation Act**, which aims to create **clear rules for issuers**.


  * **Lack of reserves** could lead to financial instability.

  * **No clear regulatory framework** leaves consumers vulnerable.

  * **Stablecoin collapses** could have ripple effects on traditional finance.


  “People have been free during most of human history to innovate in the creation of private money without government interference,” Guynn noted. However, he argued that **modern financial stability requires proper oversight**.

  ### The Future of Stablecoin Regulation


  **Should stablecoins be regulated as banks, money market funds, or a new category?**


  Guynn’s testimony adds to the debate over **how stablecoins should be classified** in the financial system. Some policymakers advocate for:


  * **Bank-like regulation**, requiring **capital and liquidity reserves**.

  * **Money market fund rules**, focusing on investor protections.

  * **A new regulatory framework**, tailored to stablecoins' unique role.

  With **Congress debating the Stablecoin Regulation Act**, the future of
  **digital dollar-backed assets** remains a **key issue** for regulators and
  the crypto industry.
