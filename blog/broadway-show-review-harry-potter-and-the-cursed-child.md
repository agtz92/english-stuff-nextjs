short-description: I was given the opportunity to go to New York City on a
  business trip and it would not have been possible for me to miss the
  opportunity to watch a Broadway show. I thought about what I wanted to see and
  looked at internet reviews on all of the different shows I could go see. I
  decided that "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" (huge Potterhead here) and
  "Wicked" would make the trip worthwhile . I booked a ticket online and took a
  day off from work so that I could enjoy all of the festivities in New York
  City.

  ## I'll keep it spoiler free... don't worry about it.


  B﻿efore continuing, you can purchase [tickets for the Harry Potter and The Cursed Child Broadway play here!](https://www.broadway.com/shows/harry-potter-and-cursed-child-broadway/)


  <br>I was so excited to learn that the play Harry Potter and the cursed child would resume its production after two years of pause due to Covid-19. It's one thing for me, who is a diehard fan at heart; it is another altogether when you add in all my other interests as well! But this news made up for everything else because now the play changed its format from a 2-day show to a single day show. That's how I saw two different plays on the same trip.


  <br>


  Before telling you about this great work by J.K Rowling (one of the best authors alive in my opinion) and how she made me fall in love with the written word all over again, will also mention how passionate I am of musical plays!

  ## First time in Broadway


  I had never been to a non-musical show before, so I went into the show with an open mind. What better way than by watching something that's new and exciting?


  <br>None of my friends have seen this play, but every one of them knows about it (Potterheads!) because we all read the book Harry Potter and the Cursed Child published in 2016. I didn't know what to expect and wasn’t sure whether there would be magic on stage; more importantly though- would we actually get some?


  <br>


  The auditorium is more than fantastic, every detail has been thought of with reference to this magical world and the souvenirs are expensive but you won't hesitate when it comes time for your walk out those doors.


  <br>The play begins with Harry, Ron and Hermione leaving their children on the 9 ¾ exrpess train to Hogwarts.

  ## Magic On Stage


  The scenery, costumes and actors bring you right back to that part of the Harry Potter story I wanted so badly. With this new play it just feels like myself 10-years ago watching the ending of the last Harry Potter movie.


  <br>The actors in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child were outstanding. They captured every detail of their characters, especially during aLive stage performances where you could see them mimicking words on-screen with fierce ensemble work that would make any theater fan proud! I was amazed at the resemblance of James Snyder with 30-year-old Daniel Radcliffe at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Brady Dalton Richards stole the show with his amazing acting as Scorpius Malfoy.

  <br>One of the best parts about being a Potterhead is that you get to experience all these moments from our favorite books and movies in person. But if I had gone into this play without really knowing what it would be like, then there were so many emotions rushing through me: joy at seeing my childhood friends come alive on stage-surprise as some scenes got darker than others; suspense because something always happened right around when one thought they knew how things would go down...

  ## Amazing Broadway Experience


  I couldn't even begin explain everything tying those feelings together! It left such an impression--one which can only grow stronger with time spent under its spell (and probably more plays).


  <br>The Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Broadway show was a great experience, one I would recommend to any true Potterhead. We were able to see two different plays on our trip: this one and Wicked which we also loved! <br>It's always hard going into a new play because you never know what it will be like but luckily for us, J.K Rowling made sure that even magic happened on stage, she still gave us enough drama to keep everyone entertained from start to finish. 


  <br>The whole production is fantastic with amazing scenery, costumes and actors who bring the story of our favorite book series right back to life in front of your eyes-and not just as words anymore either! You can really feel how passionate they are about their work and it makes for a great show. If you're looking for something new to do and love the Harry Potter series, then I highly recommend this play! It's worth every penny.
