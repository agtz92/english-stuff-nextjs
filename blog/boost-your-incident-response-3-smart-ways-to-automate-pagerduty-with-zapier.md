  ### Automatiza la creación de incidentes en PagerDuty


  **Olvídate de crear incidentes manualmente: conecta tus herramientas favoritas y deja que Zapier lo haga por ti.**


  In any growing tech operation, the faster you identify and respond to incidents, the better. But creating new PagerDuty incidents by hand is tedious, error-prone, and just plain inefficient. Whether it’s from email, chat, or monitoring tools, manually entering incident data wastes valuable time your team could be using to solve the problem.


  Thanks to Zapier, you can set up "Zaps"—automated workflows—that instantly trigger PagerDuty incidents from a variety of sources. For example, if someone sends a message in a Slack channel, marks a chat as urgent in Intercom, or logs an issue via Google Forms, a new incident can be created automatically in PagerDuty.


  This also applies to your monitoring stack. If your uptime tool detects a service is down, Zapier can route that alert to PagerDuty immediately—no human handoff required. The result? Faster alerts, smoother handoffs, and quicker resolutions.

  ### Informa a tu equipo de inmediato sobre nuevos incidentes


  **Centraliza las notificaciones y asegúrate de que nadie se pierda un incidente importante.**


  Even the best alerting systems fall short if your team doesn’t see the notification. With multiple platforms competing for attention—Slack, email, Discord, SMS—it’s easy for crucial alerts to slip through the cracks.


  Zapier lets you instantly notify your team wherever they’re already working. A new incident in PagerDuty? That can trigger a direct message in Slack, an email summary, or even a notification in Discord. With just a few clicks, you can customize how and when your team is alerted.


  Want to reduce alert fatigue? You can add filters or digests in Zapier to limit notifications to high-priority issues or bundle alerts into a once-a-day summary. That way, your team stays informed without being overwhelmed.

  ### Duplica incidentes en otras plataformas para colaboración cruzada


  **Haz llegar los datos de incidentes a los equipos correctos, sin exponer información sensible.**


  Not everyone in your company needs access to PagerDuty. Sometimes, for security or cost reasons, it's better to limit access. But when incidents require cross-team collaboration, how do you share the information?


  Zapier solves this by duplicating incidents into platforms your other teams already use—like Asana, Notion, Jira, or Google Sheets. As soon as an incident is created in PagerDuty, a task or record appears in the linked platform, complete with key details for context.


  You can even use formatter steps to clean up raw data before sharing it. For example, strip out system logs, convert timestamps to readable formats, or extract summaries. This ensures each team sees exactly what they need—nothing more, nothing less.

  ### Usa automatización programada para mantener el control


  **No esperes a que algo falle: crea incidentes rutinarios para tareas preventivas y de monitoreo.**


  Not all incidents are emergencies. Sometimes, they’re reminders to run checks, verify backups, or monitor long-running jobs. Scheduled incidents help teams stay proactive instead of reactive.


  With Zapier’s schedule triggers, you can create daily or weekly PagerDuty incidents automatically. Need a morning prompt to check logs? A scheduled reminder for sprint planning? Or a weekly summary of critical systems? You can set it and forget it.


  This is especially useful for distributed teams working across time zones. Automated schedules ensure that operational rhythms are maintained consistently, regardless of who’s online.

  ### Integra reportes de clientes directamente con PagerDuty


  **Acelera la resolución de problemas conectando tu soporte al sistema de incidentes.**


  When a customer reports an issue, every second counts. But if that report has to be escalated manually through multiple tools, your response time suffers—and so does your customer’s trust.


  Zapier lets you close that gap. If someone submits a bug through a form, tags a chat as urgent in Intercom, or files a ticket in Freshdesk, you can instantly trigger a PagerDuty incident. No handoffs. No delay.


  Even if your support tool isn’t natively supported, you can use webhooks to connect it to PagerDuty. Just define your trigger and push the data. Add filter steps to make sure only high-priority tickets become incidents, and your team can focus on what matters most—fixing the issue quickly.
