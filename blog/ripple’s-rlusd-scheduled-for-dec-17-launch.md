  ### RLUSD Goes Live


  **A global rollout on XRP Ledger and Ethereum**


  Ripple’s RLUSD will launch simultaneously on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain, providing a bridge between traditional finance and web3 applications. The stablecoin has received final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), known as the regulatory "gold standard."


  Initially available in regions like the Americas, U.K., Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, RLUSD will feature on platforms such as Uphold, MoonPay, Bitso, Bullish, Mercado, and CoinMENA.

  ### Strategic Positioning


  **Ripple CEO emphasizes trust and utility**


  Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse underlined the importance of launching RLUSD under NYDFS's charter, positioning it as a trusted stablecoin in the evolving regulatory landscape. He noted that stablecoins like RLUSD are becoming critical tools for liquidity and cross-border transactions, especially as global policymakers clarify crypto regulations.

  ### Challenges and Competition


  **Navigating regulatory hurdles and market dominance**


  While Ripple’s RLUSD is primed for a strong entry, it faces stiff competition in the $200 billion stablecoin market. Tether (USDT) dominates with a $140 billion market cap, followed by Circle’s USDC, which already has a strong foothold in the U.S.


  Additionally, RLUSD is not yet available in the E.U. due to pending MiCA approvals. This regulatory gap could delay adoption in key markets despite its global launch.

  ### Advisory Support and Future Prospects


  **Renowned experts bolster Ripple’s board**


  Ripple recently added two prominent members to its stablecoin advisory board:


  * **Raghuram Rajan**, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India

  * **Kenneth Montgomery**, former COO of Boston’s Federal Reserve Bank


  They join Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and ex-FDIC chair Sheila Bair to strengthen Ripple’s position in the stablecoin sector.

  Ripple CTO David Schwartz cautioned against speculative trading of RLUSD, warning that supply shortages may create initial volatility. "Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin. This is not an opportunity to get rich," Schwartz stated.
