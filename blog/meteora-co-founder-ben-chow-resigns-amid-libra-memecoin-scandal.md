  ### **LIBRA Memecoin: The Catalyst for the Controversy**


  **LIBRAâ€™s meteoric rise and dramatic fall fuel speculation**


  LIBRA, the memecoin at the center of the scandal, gained sudden traction after **Argentine President Javier Milei** referenced it publicly. Following his remarks, LIBRA's value skyrocketed to over $4 before crashing below $0.50, leaving many retail investors in significant losses.


  Reports suggest that insiders may have cashed out over **$100 million**, leading to speculation of market manipulation. This incident underscores the inherent volatility and risks associated with memecoin trading, often driven by social media hype and influential endorsements.

  In response to the LIBRA debacle, **Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ)** has pledged to donate **150 Binance Coin (BNB)** to assist victims of the scam.

  This case serves as a stark reminder of the risks in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the need for increased transparency. As the investigation unfolds, the crypto industry will be watching closely to see if any legal repercussions arise from the LIBRA collapse.
