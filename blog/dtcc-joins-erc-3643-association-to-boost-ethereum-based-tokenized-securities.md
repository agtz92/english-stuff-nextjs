short-description: >-
  The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the largest U.S.
  clearinghouse for securities, has officially joined the ERC-3643 Association,
  marking a pivotal step in the advancement of Ethereum-based tokenized
  securities. The move underscores DTCC’s growing interest in blockchain
  solutions tailored for regulated financial markets.


  ERC-3643, also known as the T-REX protocol, is an open-source smart contract standard aimed at enabling the issuance and management of permissioned tokens on Ethereum. These tokens are designed to be held only by authorized individuals or entities, even on public blockchains, thanks to the integration of a decentralized identity verification layer.

  ### Expanding Use of ERC-3643


  **Adoption and Asset Management Across Jurisdictions**


  More than 40 different tokens have been launched using ERC-3643, representing over **$28 billion in tokenized assets** across more than 180 countries. This standard enables compliance with various regulatory environments while maintaining the benefits of decentralized infrastructure.


  ERC-3643’s features are particularly suited for financial instruments like tokenized bonds, equities, and funds that require rigorous identity verification and regulatory compliance.

  ### ComposerX Integration


  **Boosting Security and Operational Efficiency**


  DTCC will integrate ERC-3643 into its proprietary ComposerXTM platform, particularly the **ComposerX Factory**, a tokenization engine for managing structured financial data. This move aims to enhance compliance, risk mitigation, and security across digital asset ecosystems, while also streamlining operations and lowering costs.


  The integration positions DTCC to play a central role in bridging traditional finance and decentralized networks, with ComposerX becoming a cornerstone for token issuance and data standardization.

  ### Strategic Implications for U.S. Finance


  **Industry-Wide Impact and Regulatory Interest**


  DTCC’s endorsement of ERC-3643 indicates growing regulatory comfort with blockchain solutions in traditional financial sectors. The firm’s adoption of tokenization follows its earlier pilots using Avalanche subnets and the Canton Network to explore on-chain settlement of U.S. Treasury Bills.


  Regulators like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are following suit. The CFTC announced a CEO Forum on February 7 to explore stablecoin applications and tokenized non-cash collateral, with participation from major firms like Circle, Coinbase, and Ripple.

### Looking Ahead

**From Trials to Mainstream Integration**

DTCC’s support for ERC-3643 not only validates the protocol's security and compliance features but also signals a shift in how real-world assets will be handled in the coming decade. By supporting Ethereum-based permissioned tokens, DTCC bridges a critical gap between traditional finance and decentralized technologies.
