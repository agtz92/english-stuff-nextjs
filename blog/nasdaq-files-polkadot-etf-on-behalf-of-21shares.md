short-description: >-
  Nasdaq has officially filed a request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
  Commission (SEC) to list a Polkadot (DOT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) on behalf
  of wealth manager 21Shares. This move marks another significant step toward
  expanding crypto ETF offerings, following the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum
  ETFs.


  The 19b-4 filing, submitted on March 18, serves as a proposal for a rule change, which is a necessary component of ETF approval. If approved, the Polkadot ETF would provide investors with regulated exposure to DOT, further integrating crypto into traditional finance.
