short-description: Shiba Inu has reached a key support zone after a sharp
  decline, signaling more potential downside. With weakening fundamentals,
  bearish technicals, and fading interest in the Shibarium network, the meme
  coin’s recovery seems increasingly unlikely in the near term.

  ### Shiba Inu Struggles to Hold Critical Support

  **Rebound Fails to Inspire Confidence**


  Shiba Inu (SHIB) bounced slightly to $0.00001199 after falling to $0.00001145—its lowest level since February. This is still nearly 65% below its 2025 high. The recovery was weak, driven more by brief market optimism than fundamental strength.


  SHIB has been caught in the broader crypto market slump, with Bitcoin and altcoins sliding under macroeconomic pressure. For SHIB, however, deeper issues remain, and recent on-chain metrics paint a troubling picture for its short-term outlook.

  ### On-Chain Data Signals Accelerated Distribution


  **Mean Dollar Invested Age and Active Addresses Drop Sharply**


  A critical bearish signal comes from the Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), which tracks how long coins have stayed dormant. Both the 90-day and 365-day MDIA metrics have fallen fast—dropping from 66 to 46 and from 205 to 143, respectively.


  This decline indicates that long-held tokens are now being moved or sold, suggesting increased distribution by early holders. At the same time, active addresses on the network have plummeted to 3,350, down from 20,000 in December, highlighting waning user interest.

  ### Shibarium Network Falters


  **TVL Collapse Undermines Layer 2 Ambitions**


  Shiba Inu’s much-hyped layer-2 solution, Shibarium, is also showing signs of struggle. The total value locked (TVL) in the network has plunged from $6.4 million in December to just $1.91 million—a dramatic collapse that puts it far behind newer blockchains like Sonic and Berachain.


  This loss of momentum in Shibarium raises concerns about SHIB’s long-term utility and ecosystem strength. Without consistent growth or usage, investor confidence in SHIB’s broader value proposition is fading.

  ### Technical Patterns Point to Breakdown


  **Double Top, Death Cross, and Falling Averages All Align Bearishly**


  The technical chart for SHIB doesn’t inspire optimism. A double-top pattern has formed at $0.00003345, with the neckline at $0.00001090—just above current prices. This classic bearish pattern is compounded by a looming death cross, where the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day average.


  With SHIB now trading below both key moving averages, momentum has turned strongly negative. A breakdown below $0.000010 would likely trigger accelerated selling, with the next major support around $0.00000583, a level last seen in mid-2023.

  ### Sentiment Weakens as Meme Coin Hype Fades


  **Retail and Speculator Interest Declines**


  The meme coin sector, once propelled by social media buzz and rapid gains, appears to be losing its shine. Without strong community-driven narratives or significant ecosystem upgrades, coins like SHIB are struggling to hold attention.

Unless SHIB can reclaim major technical levels and reinvigorate user activity, it may continue its downward trajectory—leaving investors to brace for a potential retest of multi-year lows.
