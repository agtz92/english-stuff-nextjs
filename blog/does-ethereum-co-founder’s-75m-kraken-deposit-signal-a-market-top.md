  The Ethereum Foundation has also faced scrutiny for similar actions. Earlier this year, the foundation sold over $12 million worth of ETH, leading to backlash from users accusing it of leveraging reserves for profit. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-creator, defended these sales, emphasizing their role in funding ecosystem initiatives and operations.
