  Laphroaig Quarter Cask is a delicious and complex whisky that has been matured twice to enhance its flavors. The second maturation takes place in smaller quarter-sized casks, allowing for more contact with wood and resulting in hints of coconut, banana, and vanilla alongside the smoky peat that Laphroaig is known for. This whisky pays tribute to traditional methods and has been awarded the prestigious 2019 San Francisco World Spirits Award Gold. Its deep and flavorful profile can be enjoyed neat, over ice, or with a splash of water. Experience the passion and craftsmanship of Laphroaig while savoring the warm and spicy oak notes that make this whisky truly special.
