  ### What’s Inside the New FDIC Correspondence?


  **Unveiling the mechanics of regulatory pressure**


  On **February 5, 2025**, the FDIC released **175 documents** detailing its interactions with banks regarding crypto-related activities. These documents, released ahead of a **U.S. Senate Banking Committee GOP hearing**, shed light on the controversial practice of **pressuring financial institutions to suspend services to crypto companies**—without clear legal grounds.


  Dubbed the “**pause letters,**” the correspondence reveals how banks were instructed to halt operations for crypto clients, with the FDIC often **ignoring follow-up queries for months**. This deliberate stalling tactic, described as **“regulation by exhaustion,”** forced banks into compliance by wearing them down through bureaucratic inertia.


  The documents also show that when banks tried to negotiate limited service agreements for crypto firms, the FDIC **pushed for stricter restrictions**, prioritizing broad bans over case-by-case assessments.

  ### An Unexpected Ally in the Fight Against Debanking


  **Bipartisan outrage and surprising support from crypto critics**


  In a rare show of **bipartisan agreement**, both Democrats and Republicans condemned the FDIC’s actions during the Senate hearing. Even **Senator Elizabeth Warren**, known for her **anti-crypto stance**, voiced concerns over unfair debanking practices. She sent a letter to **President Trump**, offering to collaborate on **reforming banking regulations** to prevent politically motivated service denials.


  While Warren’s letter **avoids mentioning cryptocurrencies directly**, it highlights that over **half of the debanking complaints** were linked to major institutions like **Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup**. Her involvement signals a potential shift in the political landscape surrounding crypto regulation.

  ### The Fallout: How Banks Were Forced to Cut Off Crypto Clients


  **A battle banks couldn’t win**


  The FDIC’s internal communications reveal a **systematic effort to isolate crypto firms from the banking system**. Despite banks’ attempts to justify the **safety and soundness** of their crypto-related transactions, the FDIC remained firm, citing vague concerns about **reputation risks, market volatility, and consumer protection**.


  Even when banks complied with FDIC directives, **crypto clients were often left without viable banking alternatives**, effectively **debanking** them from the financial ecosystem. The documents suggest that **regulatory overreach**, rather than financial risk, was the driving force behind these actions.

  ### What’s Next for Crypto and the FDIC?


  **Regulatory reforms on the horizon**


  With a new **pro-crypto leadership** at the FDIC under **Chairman Travis Hill**, there’s a clear intention to **reverse the anti-crypto policies** of the past. Hill announced plans to **reevaluate the FDIC’s supervisory approach** to crypto-related activities, signaling the end of **Operation Choke Point 2.0**.


  Key reforms include:


  * **Replacing Financial Institution Letter (FIL) 16-2022**, which required banks to report all crypto-related activities for FDIC review.

  * **Collaborating with the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets** to create more balanced regulations.

  * **Focusing on safety and soundness** without stifling innovation in the crypto space.


  These changes suggest a **more favorable environment for crypto companies**, with the potential for **restored banking access** and **reduced regulatory hostility**.
