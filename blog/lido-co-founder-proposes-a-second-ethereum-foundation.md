  #### A Vision for Competition


  Lomashuk introduced the idea of a Second Foundation in December, arguing that it would foster competition and give the community more options. He believes the current Ethereum Foundation (EF) is overly centralized and too focused on layer-2 networks, neglecting Ethereum's core layer.

  The proposal arises amid criticism of the EF's governance structure. Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin recently unveiled plans to overhaul EF’s decision-making process. However, critics argue these changes contradict Ethereum’s decentralization ethos, with concerns about potential centralization of power.

  #### Lido’s Role in Ethereum Staking


  As the largest ETH validator, Lido plays a key role in securing the Ethereum blockchain. With 28% of staked ETH under its platform, Lido is central to the ecosystem, making Lomashuk's call for change particularly influential.
