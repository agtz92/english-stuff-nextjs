  ### Crypto Exchange Traffic on the Rise


  **Sharp increase linked to Bitcoin rally**\

  In early November, Russian internet traffic to crypto exchanges rose by 8%, reflecting a global trend of 8%–10% growth across the top 20 exchanges. Russian users contributed roughly 27% to 30% of total traffic, fueled by Bitcoin’s 45% climb from $68,000 to $99,000 during the month.

  MegaFon highlighted Deribit’s standout performance, with a 126% increase in Russian visits in early November. Other platforms, such as HTX (formerly Huobi) and KuCoin, also saw significant growth, reporting traffic increases of 24% and 23%, respectively.


  However, not all exchanges benefited. Gate.io reported a 26% drop in traffic, while Upbit and Kraken experienced declines of 6% and 4%, respectively.

  ### Impact of Russia’s New Crypto Mining Laws


  **Regulatory changes spur market interest**\

  The surge in crypto traffic coincides with the implementation of Russia’s new crypto mining law on November 1. This legislation restricts mining to registered entrepreneurs and organizations, capping non-entrepreneurial miners at 6,000 kWh of electricity per month.


  Additional mining restrictions, set to begin on December 1, will temporarily ban mining in certain regions until March 2025 due to electricity shortages.
