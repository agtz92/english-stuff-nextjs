  Adding to concerns, **U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded five consecutive days of net outflows**, signaling a potential loss of institutional confidence in BTC.

  ### **Rising Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges and Whale Sell-Offs**


  Bitcoin recently **hit an all-time high above $109,000** before reversing course. Key market forces, including **institutional outflows, U.S. macroeconomic conditions, and increased BTC supply on exchanges**, have contributed to its decline.


  According to **on-chain data from Santiment**, the **supply of Bitcoin on exchanges is rising**, while **whale wallets are offloading BTC**. This shift suggests that **major investors are moving their holdings from private wallets to exchanges**, a common **prelude to increased selling pressure**.


  A decline in **Bitcoin held by funds** further reinforces bearish sentiment. Data from **Farside Investors** shows that **spot Bitcoin funds are experiencing net outflows**, a red flag for future price movement.

  ### **Institutional Investors Are Pulling Back**

  Data from **CoinShares** confirms a significant **capital outflow from Bitcoin funds**:


  * **$595 million** in BTC outflows month-to-date.

  * **$571 million** in outflows in the past week alone.

  * Meanwhile, **Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and multi-asset funds are seeing inflows**.


  These figures indicate a **shifting preference among institutional investors**, who may be diversifying into alternative crypto assets while **reducing exposure to Bitcoin**.


  Adding to the bearish sentiment, **MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock has taken a hit** as investors question its high valuation relative to its Bitcoin holdings. Analysts at **10x Research** believe that **MSTR was overvalued by nearly 60%**, leading to a significant sell-off.

  ### **Whales Are Selling Bitcoin**


  Whale activity has played a crucial role in Bitcoin’s recent price swings. **Santiment’s on-chain data** reveals:


  * A **decline in whale transactions** valued at **$100,000 or more**.

  * A **similar drop in transactions above $1 million**.

  * An increase in **profit-taking activity**, further increasing sell pressure.


  Consistent **whale profit-taking** can contribute to **price declines**, as large holders liquidate their positions before a deeper correction occurs.

  ### **Key Support Levels and the Next Big Bitcoin Trade**


  ![](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-5.57.01%E2%80%AFPM.png.webp)


  Bitcoin recently **fell below the $90,000 level**, triggering a technical reassessment. According to **crypto analysts**, BTC’s next major **support zones** are:


  * **$85,072 (S1)**

  * **$81,500 (S2)**

  * **$76,900 (S3)**


  If Bitcoin **breaks below these levels**, the next **critical support is $70,577**—its **pre-election price level**. Should that support fail, BTC may **test liquidity at $67,476**, increasing the risk of a deeper correction.


  However, **bullish factors remain in play**. Bitcoin is still **12% below its $100,000 milestone**, and renewed **buying pressure or favorable macroeconomic developments** could spark a **reversal rally**.

### **Technical Patterns Suggest Further Downside**

According to **Markus Thielen, CEO of 10xResearch**, Bitcoin is currently trading within an **Ascending Broadening Wedge** pattern, characterized by:

* **Widening price action**
* **A wedge-like formation**
* **A setup that often precedes a correction**

Thielen warns that **if BTC follows this pattern, a downside breakout is possible**. However, confirmation from **volume trends and further price action** is needed before making definitive predictions.

### **Market Reactions and Expert Insights**

The recent **Bybit hack**, which resulted in a **$1.4 billion theft of Ethereum by North Korea’s Lazarus Group**, added additional volatility to the market. However, analysts suggest that **the broader industry has responded positively**, with Bybit fully replenishing its reserves through **industry loans and OTC purchases**.

Dr. **Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive.xyz**, commented on the ongoing **institutional exit from BTC ETFs**, stating:

*"Bitcoin has seen a 4.5% drop in the last 24 hours, most likely due to the continued exodus of institutional funds. More than $900 million in BTC ETF outflows have been recorded in the past three weeks. Investors are reacting to macroeconomic volatility, including geopolitical tensions and the possibility of rising interest rates."*

Dawson further noted:

* The **chance of BTC reaching $100K by March 28** has **fallen to 30%**, down from **39% just 24 hours ago**.
* The probability of **BTC hitting $125K by June 27** has dropped from **19% to 15%**.

In response to these developments, **crypto traders have adjusted their positions**, causing a slight rise in **BTC’s 7-day at-the-money implied volatility (ATM IV) to 46%**, indicating increased market uncertainty.
