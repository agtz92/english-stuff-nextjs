  ### Exaion Joins Etherlink to Strengthen L2 Infrastructure


  **Institutional Validator Brings Added Security to Tezos Ecosystem**


  Exaion has officially become a validator for Etherlink, Tezos’ layer 2 blockchain designed to integrate with Ethereum's EVM tools. As a subsidiary of France’s EDF Group, Exaion brings enterprise-grade credibility and infrastructure to the fast-growing L2 platform.


  The move marks another step in Exaion’s ongoing partnership with Tezos, following its entry as a corporate baker in 2020. With this new role, Exaion will support the integrity of Etherlink’s Smart Rollup system while enhancing security for users and developers deploying on the chain.

  ### Etherlink: Tezos' Strategic EVM-Compatible Layer


  **Built for Interoperability, Speed, and Scalability**


  Launched in late 2024, Etherlink is Tezos’ answer to the growing demand for scalable Ethereum-compatible solutions. It leverages smart rollups to maintain performance without sacrificing decentralization.


  The platform supports seamless integration with popular Ethereum tools like wallets, block explorers, and indexers. It also connects to other EVM-compatible chains, making it an attractive destination for DeFi and RWA (real-world asset) projects.

  ### Institutional Confidence in a Growing Ecosystem


  **High-Profile Support Enhances Etherlink’s Credibility**


  Exaion’s entry adds to Etherlink’s growing list of validators and supporters. Projects like Spiko, a money market fund platform, and Midas, a Coinbase-backed RWA platform, have already launched on Etherlink, demonstrating its traction.


  Arthur Breitman, Tezos co-founder, emphasized the importance of trusted validators: “Rollup security relies on the presence of at least one honest validator… the more reputable parties validating the Etherlink rollup, the more robust it is.”

  ### Focus on Security, Performance, and Digital Sovereignty


  **A French Technological Alliance Gaining Momentum**


  Fatih Balyeli, CEO of Exaion, highlighted Etherlink as a natural extension of the company’s mission: “We’re proud to continue supporting Tezos, an example of French technological ingenuity that aligns with our own mission.”


  By providing high-quality digital infrastructure, Exaion not only enhances Etherlink’s validator set but also reinforces France’s growing role in blockchain innovation and sovereign infrastructure.

  ### Etherlink’s Future: More Projects, More Validators


  **Decentralization and Utility Drive Adoption**


  As Etherlink continues to attract new use cases—from tokenized assets to smart contract platforms—its validator base will be crucial for long-term resilience. Exaion’s involvement is likely to inspire other institutional players to join, ensuring that Etherlink grows securely while keeping pace with Ethereum-native solutions.
