short-description: Ethereum (ETH) has been struggling below the $2,700 level,
  even as Bitcoin shows resilience. However, on-chain metrics and whale
  accumulation suggest that a major price rebound could be on the horizon. With
  institutional adoption still lagging, traders are debating whether Ethereum is
  gearing up for a rally or facing further stagnation.

  ### **Ethereum Price Struggles Despite Bullish On-Chain Metrics**


  ![](https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2025/02/Ethereum-ETH-19.12.48-11-Feb-2025.png.webp)


  **Key Highlights:**


  * Ethereum holder count surged to **138.98 million**, adding nearly **500,000 new addresses** in one week.

  * Traders selling ETH at a loss could signal **capitulation and potential price recovery**.

  * **Derivatives market turning bullish**, with open interest reaching **$8.03 billion**.


  Ethereum’s price action has remained unimpressive, but **on-chain data suggests growing network activity**. The total number of ETH holders continues to rise, while derivatives traders are positioning themselves for a recovery. The **increase in large negative profit/loss spikes** indicates that many traders have exited at a loss—often a precursor to a market bottom.

   *Could Ethereum be setting the stage for a sharp rebound?*

  ### **Whale Accumulation vs. Institutional Uncertainty**


  **Key Insights:**


  * **Whales are accumulating Ethereum**, increasing their holdings by nearly **500,000 ETH in February 2025**.

  * **Institutional interest in Ethereum ETFs remains uncertain**, with recent **$22.5 million outflows**.

  * **Spot ETF inflows remain sluggish**, while Bitcoin ETFs continue to dominate institutional investment.


  While whales are accumulating ETH **off exchanges**, institutional investors appear hesitant. The **lack of significant ETF inflows** suggests that institutions remain undecided about Ethereum’s long-term prospects compared to Bitcoin.

   *Could Ethereum’s price remain suppressed if institutional demand doesn’t pick up?*

  ### **Ethereum’s Strong Fundamentals: A Long-Term Bull Case**


  | **Metric**                  | **Current Status**           |

  | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

  | **Total ETH Holders**       | 138.98 million (record high) |

  | **ETH Staked Percentage**   | **27%** (down from 29%)      |

  | **Ethereum Open Interest**  | $8.03 billion (bullish)      |

  | **Institutional ETF Flows** | Weak, with outflows recorded |


  Ethereum’s fundamental value remains intact despite short-term struggles. The network is processing **over $30 billion in daily transactions**, largely powered by **Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Base, and zkSync**.

   *With Ethereum’s DeFi and NFT dominance, is the market underestimating its long-term potential?*

  ### **Bearish Pressure: Institutional Investors Shift Toward Bitcoin**

   **Key Challenges Facing Ethereum:**

  * **ETH staking has plateaued**, dropping from **29% to 27%** in recent months.

  * **Layer 2 chains are offering higher rewards**, drawing liquidity away from ETH staking.

  * **Institutional investors favor Bitcoin**, leaving Ethereum in a relative disadvantage.


  Ethereum remains the backbone of the **DeFi and NFT ecosystem**, but **competition from Layer 2 solutions** and shifting investor sentiment towards **Bitcoin ETFs** have impacted its price trajectory.

  ### **Long-Term Outlook: Is Ethereum Ready for a Comeback?**


  Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, believes Ethereum is nearing a **long-term accumulation phase**, stating:

   *“Institutional investors see Ethereum approaching a strong support level, making it an attractive buy for long-term accumulation. Historically, this type of institutional entry has preceded market recoveries.”*
