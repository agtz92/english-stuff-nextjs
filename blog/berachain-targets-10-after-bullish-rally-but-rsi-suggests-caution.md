short-description: V   Berachain has surged over 36% in the past week,
  approaching a key resistance zone at $8.34. Traders now speculate whether the
  momentum can carry it beyond $10, despite early signs of overbought
  conditions.

  ### Strong recovery backed by technical indicators


  **After a period of consolidation, Berachain has regained strength**


  Currently priced at $7.89, Berachain has seen a significant bounce backed by bullish indicators. The RSI has reached 59, signaling strong momentum but nearing overbought territory. The Bollinger Bands show price tightening, hinting at a potential breakout or retracement in the near term.

  ### Resistance ahead and RSI close to critical level


  **Traders monitor the $8.34 level for signs of continuation**


  The main resistance level lies at $8.34. A successful breakout here could push Berachain toward the $10 psychological barrier. However, if resistance holds, a pullback toward $6.53 or even the stronger $5.14 support level could follow. RSI's proximity to overbought levels suggests caution.

  ### Momentum intact, but volume signals cooling


  **Indicators remain positive while volume eases**


  The MACD remains positive at 0.282, confirming continued upward pressure. Yet, trading volume has dropped 33% in the past 24 hours to $187.7 million. This cooling of buyer interest could indicate a pause before the next move.

  ### On-chain metrics boost bullish sentiment


  **Growth in TVL and DEX activity reinforces optimism**


  Berachainâ€™s total value locked (TVL) has increased to $3.14 billion, nearing its previous high of $3.26 billion. Between March 23 and March 25, decentralized exchange volume surged from $36 million to $132 million, reflecting renewed activity and demand.

  ### Proof-of-liquidity launch adds fuel to the rally


  **New reward system drives user participation and incentives**


  The launch of the proof-of-liquidity (POL) system on March 24 opened new reward mechanisms outside traditional BEX pools. Within hours, active incentives reached $355,000, and the top vault offered an APR exceeding 200%. This has contributed to a bullish outlook among users and investors.
