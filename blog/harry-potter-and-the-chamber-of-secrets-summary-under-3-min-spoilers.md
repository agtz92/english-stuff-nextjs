  "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is the second book in the seven-book
  series written by J.K. Rowling. The story continues the adventures of young
  wizard Harry Potter and his best friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley,
  during their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


  The book begins at Privet Drive, where Harry lives with his abusive relatives, the Dursleys. Harry hasn't heard from his friends all summer, and he is punished for using magic to inflate his Aunt Marge. Soon after, he receives a warning from the Ministry of Magic for using magic outside school while underage. 


  Harry's escape from the Dursleys comes in the form of a flying car, driven by Ron Weasley and his brothers, Fred and George. They bring him back to their home, the Burrow, where Harry spends the rest of his summer. 


  While purchasing school supplies at Diagon Alley, Harry encounters Gilderoy Lockhart, a self-obsessed wizard and author, who has been appointed as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Harry also has a threatening encounter with Lucius Malfoy, the father of his school rival Draco.

  The journey to Hogwarts is eventful as the magical platform 9¾ unexpectedly
  closes, leaving Harry and Ron unable to board the Hogwarts Express. They
  decide to fly the Weasley’s enchanted car to Hogwarts, but crash into the
  Whomping Willow on the school grounds. As punishment for arriving in such an
  ostentatious manner and damaging the tree, both boys receive detention.


  Strange things start happening at Hogwarts. Students are found petrified, apparently by a mysterious creature. The only clue is a message found at one of the attack sites saying that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened. The school is rife with rumors about the Chamber, supposedly built by Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts, and home to a monster that only his true heir can control.

  Harry, Ron, and Hermione begin an independent investigation. In the process, they learn about the concept of "Mudbloods," a derogatory term for wizards and witches of non-magical parentage, from Draco Malfoy. Draco suggests that the attacks on the Muggle-born students are the work of the Heir of Slytherin.

  During a dueling club session, Harry discovers he can speak Parseltongue, the
  snake language, an unusual ability that Salazar Slytherin also possessed. This
  discovery leads many in the school to suspect that Harry might be the Heir of
  Slytherin.


  Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect that Draco Malfoy might be the Heir of Slytherin, so they create Polyjuice Potion to disguise themselves as Draco's friends and extract information from him. However, Draco is not the Heir.

  As the trio continues to investigate, Hermione is petrified, leaving Harry and Ron on their own. Later, Harry finds a diary owned by a former student, Tom Riddle. The diary is enchanted, and through it, Riddle shows Harry a memory of fifty years ago, where Riddle accused Hagrid, the school's gamekeeper, of opening the Chamber of Secrets.

  Convinced of Hagrid's innocence, Harry and Ron decide to question him.
  However, before they can get any answers, Hagrid is arrested, and Dumbledore
  is suspended as Headmaster. Before leaving, Hagrid cryptically tells the boys
  to "follow the spiders," leading them to a giant spider named Aragog who
  reveals that the true monster of the Chamber is a creature that spiders fear
  above all others.


  When Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, is taken into the Chamber, Harry and Ron discover the entrance to the Chamber in a bathroom haunted by a ghost named Moaning Myrtle. Professor Lockhart, who had been tasked to save Ginny, is revealed to be a fraud when his memory charm backfires while in the Chamber with Harry and Ron, causing him to lose his own memory

  Harry proceeds alone into the Chamber of Secrets, where he finds an unconscious Ginny and a ghostly manifestation of Tom Riddle. Riddle reveals that he's been controlling Ginny through the diary, making her open the Chamber of Secrets, and he also discloses his true identity as Lord Voldemort (Tom Marvolo Riddle).

  Harry is then confronted by the monster of the Chamber, a Basilisk, whose gaze
  can kill. However, he gets help from Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes, who blinds
  the Basilisk, and a Sorting Hat that gives him the Sword of Godric Gryffindor.
  With these aids, Harry slays the Basilisk.


  Harry uses a Basilisk fang to destroy the diary, which also destroys Riddle's memory and saves Ginny. Fawkes heals Harry with his tears, which have healing powers, and then carries them, along with Ron and a memory-less Lockhart, out of the Chamber.


  When Harry explains the entire event to Dumbledore, the headmaster confirms that destroying the diary, a piece of Voldemort's soul, makes Harry the true heir of Gryffindor. Harry also figures out that Lucius Malfoy had slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron in the bookstore to open the Chamber of Secrets and discredit Arthur Weasley and Dumbledore.


  Dobby, the Malfoy family house-elf, who had been trying to protect Harry throughout the year, reveals that the diary was his master's. Harry, realizing that the diary is what made Dobby disobey his masters, tricks Lucius Malfoy into freeing Dobby.


  With the mystery solved, those who were petrified, including Hermione, are revived. Hagrid is released from Azkaban, and life returns to normal at Hogwarts. The school year ends with Gryffindor winning the house cup, and Harry, for the moment, is free to return to the Dursleys, looking forward to the freedom of the summer.
