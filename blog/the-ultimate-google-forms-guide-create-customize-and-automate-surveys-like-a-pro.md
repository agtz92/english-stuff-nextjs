  ### Getting Started: How to Create a Google Form


  **Build your first form from scratch or a template in just a few clicks.**


  To begin creating your survey, head over to [docs.google.com/forms](https://docs.google.com/forms?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Click on **Blank form** or choose a pre-made template to get started quickly.


  If you're working in Google Sheets, go to **Tools > Create a new form**, and a blank form linked to your spreadsheet will be generated automatically.


  The Google Forms editor is intuitive. Click into any field to edit your question, and use the floating toolbar on the right to add more questions, images, videos, or sections. You can also change question types using a simple dropdown.


  There are 12 question types available:


  * **Short answer** and **Paragraph** for text responses

  * **Multiple choice**, **Checkboxes**, and **Dropdown** for selection-based questions

  * **File upload** to collect documents or images

  * **Linear scale** and **Rating** for feedback

  * **Grids** (Multiple choice and Checkbox) for matrix-style answers

  * **Date** and **Time** for scheduling or timestamp questions


  You can also insert YouTube videos or images as standalone items or attach them to questions.

  ### Using Sections and Logic to Make Smarter Forms


  **Break up long forms and guide users based on their answers with form logic.**


  If your form has more than a few questions, it’s a good idea to split it into sections. Use the **Add section** button (equals sign icon) to break up your form and improve user experience.


  Want to personalize the form flow based on a user’s answer? Use **form logic**:


  1. Add a **Multiple choice** or **Dropdown** question.

  2. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) in the question box.

  3. Select **Go to section based on answer**.


  You can now control where users are directed based on how they respond—great for RSVPs, feedback routing, or conditional forms.


  Always preview your form (eye icon at the top) to make sure it flows correctly and doesn’t loop back on itself.

  ### How to Turn Your Form into an Interactive Quiz


  **Make quizzes with automatic scoring, answer keys, and feedback built-in.**


  Transform your form into a quiz by going to [g.co/createaquiz](https://g.co/createaquiz?utm_source=chatgpt.com) or clicking **Settings > Make this a quiz**.


  Once enabled, choose:


  * Whether to release grades immediately or later

  * If respondents can see missed/correct answers

  * Point values and custom feedback


  Click on **Answer key** in each question box to:


  * Mark the correct answer(s)

  * Assign point values

  * Add custom feedback for right/wrong answers


  This works with **Multiple choice**, **Checkboxes**, **Short answer**, and even **Date** fields, making it ideal for everything from school quizzes to onboarding tests.

  ### Customizing the Look and Feel of Your Form


  **Add personality or match your brand with themes, images, and colors.**


  Tired of the default purple theme? Click the **Customize Theme** icon (paint palette) at the top to change the form’s:


  * **Header image**

  * **Font style**

  * **Theme and background color**


  Want to share your form as a reusable template? Use this workaround:


  * Click the **More icon (⋮)** > **Make a copy**

  * Edit the copied version as needed

  * Share it with collaborators or as a template link


  This approach lets you easily create branded form templates that others can duplicate and use.

  ### Sharing and Automating Google Form Responses


  **Distribute your form via link, email, embed code, or pre-filled links—and turn responses into action.**


  Once your form is ready, click **Send**. You can share it:


  * **Via email** (embed form in the message)

  * **As a link** (shorten the URL if needed)

  * **As an embed code** for your website


  Want to pre-fill parts of a form? Click **Get pre-filled link**, complete the fields, and share the generated URL. Note: Google doesn’t store these, so generate a new one each time.


  Need a paper or PDF version? Click **Print** to create a ballot-style version you can save or distribute offline.


  As responses come in, click the **Responses** tab to view summaries, graphs, and individual answers. Click **View in Sheets** to export the data to Google Sheets for analysis or storage.


  Want to change where responses go? Click **More (⋮)** > **Select destination for responses** to pick or create a new spreadsheet.


  Google Forms automatically syncs field names and new submissions to your connected sheet. If you delete or unlink the spreadsheet, don’t worry—Forms still keeps your data and can re-sync it with a new sheet.
