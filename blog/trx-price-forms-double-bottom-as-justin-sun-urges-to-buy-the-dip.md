  ### Significant Price Decline


  **TRX drops over 50% from December highs**\

  TRX plummeted to $0.2200, marking a sharp decline of more than 50% from its December peak. This drop reduced Tron's market cap from over $26 billion to $19 billion. Despite this downturn, Justin Sun remains bullish, emphasizing that Tron is undervalued.

  ### Strong DeFi and USDT Transaction Growth


  **Tron excels in DeFi and stablecoin transactions**\

  Tron ranks third in decentralized finance (DeFi), trailing only Ethereum and Solana, with $6.69 billion in total value locked. Additionally, Tron leads in Tether (USDT) transactions due to its lower fees, processing $137 billion in USDT transfers—a 91% increase in a single day. The network boasts over 59.2 million USDT holders.

  ### Robust On-Chain Activity and Staking Rewards


  **Active users and staking yields support growth**\

  Tron maintains steady activity with 2.17 million monthly active addresses, second only to Solana. Its decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have processed nearly $100 billion in volume. Furthermore, Tron offers a 4.52% staking yield, bolstered by increasing network fees and a shrinking circulating supply, now at 86.17 billion TRX.

  ### Technical Analysis: Bullish Double Bottom


  **Chart signals possible price recovery**\

  Tron's daily chart reveals a double-bottom pattern at $0.2245, signaling a potential bullish reversal. A breakout above the neckline at $0.2760 could spark a recovery. However, if TRX falls below $0.2245, it risks dropping to $0.20, following its long-term ascending trendline.
