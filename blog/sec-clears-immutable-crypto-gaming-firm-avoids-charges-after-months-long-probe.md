  ### SEC shifts crypto enforcement strategy


  **Agency drops multiple high-profile cases as it pivots toward clarity**


  The SEC’s move aligns with a wider trend in 2025 of closing crypto investigations without action. Companies like Uniswap, Robinhood, Gemini, and OpenSea have also seen probes dropped.
