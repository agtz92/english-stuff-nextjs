short-description: Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has reached a $61.5
  billion valuation following a $3.5 billion funding round, highlighting its
  rapid rise as a major player in the AI industry. However, FTX’s early
  investment in the company and subsequent liquidation of its stake has left the
  now-defunct crypto exchange missing out on a multi-billion-dollar windfall.

  ### **Anthropic’s Growth and Strategic Funding**


  Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees, Anthropic has quickly established itself as a leader in artificial intelligence. The company is best known for its Claude AI models, with the latest version, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities.


  The latest funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners, Cisco Investments, Fidelity, Jane Street, and Salesforce Ventures. The capital will support advancements in AI technology, computational expansion, research in AI alignment, and international expansion into key markets in Asia and Europe.

  ### **FTX’s Investment and Lost Opportunity**


  FTX’s connection to Anthropic dates back to 2021, when the crypto exchange invested $500 million for an 8% stake in the AI firm. However, following FTX’s bankruptcy in 2022, its estate moved to liquidate assets to repay creditors.


  * **March 2024:** FTX sold two-thirds of its stake for $884 million to a group of investors, including Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund.

  * **June 2024:** The remaining 15 million shares were sold at $30 per share, generating over $450 million.


  In total, FTX recovered about $1.3 billion from these sales. While this helped fund creditor repayments, it pales in comparison to the $5 billion valuation that the same stake would have held today.

  ### **The Cost of Forced Liquidation**


  Had FTX managed to hold onto its Anthropic stake, the investment would have yielded nearly 10 times its original value. Instead, the bankruptcy-driven sell-off limited potential gains, illustrating the long-term impact of FTX’s collapse.


  With Anthropic continuing to expand and AI development accelerating, the lost fortune serves as a reminder of the consequences of financial mismanagement and forced liquidation.

  ### **Looking Ahead: AI’s Continued Growth**


  Anthropic’s trajectory remains strong, with ongoing investment fueling its innovations. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into industries worldwide, the company’s growth could further amplify the missed opportunity for FTX.


  For creditors and investors, the liquidation of FTX’s Anthropic stake will remain one of the most significant lost fortunes in crypto history.
