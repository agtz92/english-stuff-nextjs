short-description: There was a flower that sat next to a stream. The flower had
  always been sheltered from the sun by the leaves of the tree. One day, the sun
  shone brighter than usual and took over all of the shade in the flower's
  space. The flower wilted and died because it couldn't survive without any
  shade.

  ## A new book on green architecture is gaining global interest. 


  [Evergreen Architecture: Buildings That Place Nature at Their Core, by Gestalten](https://gestalten.com/products/evergreen-architecture), has quickly become one of the most popular books in the field of sustainable design. The book discusses how plants can be incorporated into buildings to reduce heating and cooling costs, increase productivity for workers, decrease pollution caused by transportation systems, and improve human well-being. It also provides a clear explanation of what "sustainable" means in architectural terms and examines case studies from around the world that demonstrate concrete examples of successful green building strategies.

  ## Sustainable and environmentally friendly structures 


  have been the focus of architects for years now. The construction process has become so much more complicated, with natural habitats being destroyed by our built environment at an alarming rate. 


  But what if designers could work within these constraints? Architectures that are inspired by nature rather than against it would provide us all a chance to live healthier lives - not just humans but also animals! In Evergreen Architecture: Overgrown Buildings & Greener Living (Gestalten 2016), you can find out how some incredible buildings use greenery as both sustainable building materials AND living space in ways never before thought possible
