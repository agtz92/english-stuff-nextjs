  ### **Illegal activities exposed**


  **Thousands of ads for scams and tools revealed.**\

  Elliptic's research uncovered Huione hosting ads promoting fraudulent schemes, laundering, and even offering physical tools and training to commit cybercrimes. The platform allegedly supported nearly 900,000 users as of January 14, 2025, and recently introduced its own stablecoin, USDH.

  ### **Tether's involvement and Huione's response**


  **Tether freezes accounts linked to Huione.**\

  Elliptic’s report followed Tether freezing Huione-linked accounts associated with the notorious Lazarus Group. Huione then attempted to rebrand as Haowang Guarantee, likely to evade scrutiny and maintain its operations.

  The USDH stablecoin operates on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Tron networks under Huione’s proprietary Huione Chain. However, its operations have sparked comparisons with other stablecoins and heightened concerns among regulators.
