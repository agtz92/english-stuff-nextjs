  ### The Journey to $107k


  **Breaking barriers and setting new milestones**


  Bitcoin crossed the psychological $100,000 mark and quickly advanced to $107,172 on Coinbase. This comes after MicroStrategy, the largest corporate BTC holder, purchased 15,350 BTC worth $1.5 billion, bringing its total holdings to 439,000 BTC.


  While Bitcoin briefly dipped to $97,044 due to profit-taking, bullish momentum returned on December 15, fueled by positive remarks from U.S. president-elect Donald Trump.

  ### Institutional Influence


  **MicroStrategy and BTC-to-gold ratio highlight adoption**


  MicroStrategy's purchase coincided with a 6.5% increase in its share price, signaling market confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset.


  Veteran trader Peter Brandt noted a new Bitcoin-to-gold ratio high of 39, meaning 39 ounces of gold are now equivalent to one BTC. With gold trading at $2,670.3 per ounce, Bitcoin's dominance over traditional safe-haven assets continues to grow.

  ### The Role of Spot Bitcoin ETFs


  **Increased inflows and rising interest**


  Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have recorded five consecutive days of net inflows, totaling $2.17 billion between December 9 and 13. Analysts attribute this trend to growing interest in regulated crypto investment vehicles, further amplified by the anticipated crypto-friendly Trump administration.

  ### Market Outlook


  **$110k target on the horizon**


  With Bitcoin’s rally showing no signs of slowing, analysts project the next resistance level at $110,000. Catalysts include a steady influx of institutional investments, regulatory clarity, and increased adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve by governments and corporations.
