  ![Christmas DIY](/assets/f0mqk62kwgebdwk-min.jpg "Christmas DIY")


  <brt>I decided to make my first Christmas wreath for the door's decoration following an instructables tutorial. I used natural materials (branches and cones) that were attached in an interesting way with toilet paper rolls! It was exciting because it felt like a new challenge every time I went outside with paint or glue gun...

  I enjoyed myself while making this beautiful bough as well as discovering what other creative things can be done by following simple rules


  <br>All you need is:


  * Toilet paper rolls (quantity depends on the size of the wreath)

  * Thick threads (yarn)

  * Paper tape

  * Coniferous branches (Christmas tree or pine)

  * Cones

  * Beads

  * Christmas balls

  * Ribbon

  * Artificial snow

  * Glue gun

  <br>This is a great tradition that many people all around the world follow, and it's been done for centuries.

  <br>All you need is:


  * 24 boxes, 150 x 150 x 150mm.

  * 2 large tubes of "Liquid nails" glue. The regular high-strength one works very well.

  * 1 large vinyl wall sticker, approximately 77cm tall x 55cm wide.

  * A set of number stickers, digits 20mm high. Scrapbooking supply places have these.
