  The crypto market remains on edge as traders await the Federal Open Market
  Committee (FOMC) decision set for 2 PM ET. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and
  XRP have seen moderate gains ahead of the announcement, with investors
  weighing potential price swings and buy-the-dip opportunities amid ongoing
  market uncertainty.


  Unlike previous bear markets, this cycle has featured shorter correction phases, followed by sharp price recoveries, making the current setup crucial for traders seeking optimal entry points.

  ### **Risk-Off Sentiment Dominates BTC, ETH, XRP Trading**


  **Traders have pulled back as market volatility increases**


  Data from **Coinglass** reveals that traders in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have **scaled back their derivatives activity** over the past 24 hours. BTC and ETH trading volumes declined by **11% and 7%**, respectively, while **XRP saw a steeper 14% drop**.


  At the same time, **liquidations have surged**, with nearly **$89 million** wiped out across the top three cryptocurrencies. This has contributed to a **risk-off sentiment**, as many traders prefer to wait for the FOMC announcement before making aggressive moves.


  However, **Open Interest (OI) data** tells a slightly different story. The total value of **open contracts** has **risen by 1.42% for Bitcoin, 4.90% for Ethereum, and 1.49% for XRP**, indicating that some investors are preparing for a volatile reaction post-FOMC.

  ### **On-Chain Analysis: Mixed Signals for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP**


  **Binance funding rates and whale movements reveal a complex market outlook**


  On-chain data from **Santiment** highlights diverging trends among Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP:


  * **Bitcoin:** Binance’s **funding rate has remained positive** for three consecutive days, signaling **bullish expectations** among derivatives traders despite reduced activity. However, **the supply of BTC held by institutional funds has been declining**, indicating possible profit-taking by large investors.

  * **Ethereum:** The amount of ETH held by **whales (excluding exchange wallets)** has remained stable, suggesting a **lack of major accumulation or distribution** ahead of the FOMC decision.

  * **XRP:** Active addresses on the XRP network **spiked on Wednesday**, following a **sharp decline on Tuesday**, which may indicate renewed trader interest.


  These mixed indicators suggest that **Bitcoin and XRP may have a slight bullish bias**, while **Ethereum’s price could remain range-bound** unless the market sees a significant external catalyst.

  ### **Trump’s Crypto Push and the FOMC Rate Decision**


  **Could political and monetary policy shifts drive the next crypto rally?**


  **Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget,** believes former President **Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance** is playing a growing role in market sentiment. While the U.S. government has yet to **officially adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset**, the idea is gaining traction.


  Chen noted that Trump’s team **favors stablecoins as a way to protect the U.S. dollar’s global reserve status**, alongside legislative moves like the **Stablecoin Bill** making progress in Congress. Additionally, macroeconomic strategist **Scott Bessent** has hinted at an impending **economic downturn**, which could shape Trump’s strategy heading into the next election.


  ### **What’s Next for Bitcoin?**


  **Bitcoin may not drop below $70,000, but short-term dips could offer buying opportunities**


  Chen predicts that **Bitcoin will remain above $70,000**, with short-term pullbacks to **$73,000–$78,000** being ideal accumulation zones. Looking ahead, she believes BTC could reach **$200,000 within the next 1-2 years** as macroeconomic conditions and institutional adoption improve.

  ### **Market Reactions to the FOMC Decision**


  **A dovish Fed could fuel a short-term crypto rally, while a hawkish stance may trigger a dip**


  **Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research,** expects the **Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates at 4.25%-4.50%**, taking a **cautious approach** amid persistent inflation and strong economic growth.


  Lee suggests that the **crypto market’s reaction will depend on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s tone**:


  * **If the Fed signals future rate cuts:** Expect **higher risk appetite** and a **potential short-term rally** in Bitcoin and altcoins.

  * **If the Fed maintains a hawkish stance:** The market could see **temporary downside pressure**, reinforcing tighter financial conditions.


  However, Lee notes that **Bitcoin’s growing resilience and increasing institutional support** may **temper any major sell-offs**.


  ### **Expected Price Ranges Post-FOMC**


  **Lee predicts that Bitcoin and Ethereum will trade within the following ranges after the FOMC announcement:**


  | Asset              | Projected Price Range (80% Confidence Level) |

  | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |

  | **Bitcoin (BTC)**  | **$80,000 – $86,000**                        |

  | **Ethereum (ETH)** | **$1,800 – $2,100**                          |


  These estimates factor in potential **macro influences, investor sentiment, and overall market liquidity**.

  ### **Bitcoin’s Next Target: $87,000**


  **Key technical indicators support a short-term BTC recovery**


  Bitcoin is showing **early signs of a rebound**, currently trading at **$83,517**. **Technical indicators suggest a possible move toward $87,000**, provided market conditions remain favorable.


  * **RSI:** The **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** is currently at **44**, sloping upward, indicating growing **bullish momentum**.

  * **MACD:** The **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)** indicator has been **flashing green histogram bars** for the **fourth consecutive day**, further reinforcing a **potential uptrend**.


  **Ethereum Outlook**: ETH gained **2.39% on the day**, approaching the **psychologically significant $2,000 level**. If momentum continues, ETH could **test resistance at $2,100**, representing a **7% gain from current levels**.

  ### **XRP Price Forecast: Potential 7% Rally**


  **XRP eyes a breakout amid ongoing regulatory developments**


  XRP is currently trading near **$0.2707**, with potential for a **7% rally** toward the **upper boundary of a Fair Value Gap** on the daily timeframe.


  * **RSI:** XRP’s **RSI has risen to 47**, approaching the **neutral 50 level**, suggesting **building momentum**.

  * **MACD:** The **MACD trend remains bullish**, supporting a **gradual price increase**.


  Two key events could influence XRP’s price action in the short term:


  1. **Ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple** – Traders are closely watching legal developments, as regulatory clarity could significantly impact XRP’s adoption and valuation.

  2. **Inclusion in the Strategic Reserve** – Trump’s **March 6 executive order** regarding a **blockchain-based financial system** may have implications for XRP’s future role in government-backed initiatives.

### **Final Thoughts: Should Traders Buy Now?**

With both **political and monetary catalysts on the horizon**, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP traders should prepare for **heightened volatility**.

* **Bitcoin remains in an accumulation zone between $73,000–$78,000**
* **Ethereum’s upside potential hinges on holding above $2,000**
* **XRP’s trajectory depends on regulatory and institutional factors**

For those **waiting on the sidelines**, the post-FOMC period could provide **strong entry points**, especially if the market **reacts negatively to Fed statements before rebounding** in the weeks ahead.
