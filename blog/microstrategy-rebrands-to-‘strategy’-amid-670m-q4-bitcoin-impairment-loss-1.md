  ### The Rebranding Move: From MicroStrategy to ‘Strategy’

  On February 5, 2025, MicroStrategy officially rebranded as **‘Strategy,’** unveiling a new logo featuring a stylized “B” to symbolize its strong association with Bitcoin. This strategic shift marks the company's **fourth consecutive quarterly loss**, yet underscores its intensified focus on Bitcoin accumulation.

  **Understanding the depth of the impairment**


  The Q4 earnings report revealed a **net loss of $670.8 million**, equivalent to **$3.03 per share**, a sharp contrast to the $89.1 million profit reported in the same period last year. This downturn was primarily due to a **$1.01 billion impairment charge** on its Bitcoin holdings—significantly higher than the $39.2 million charge from the previous year. However, **new fair-value accounting rules** set to be adopted in Q1 2025 may help stabilize future earnings.

As of January 27, 2025, the company holds **471,107 BTC**, valued at approximately **$46 billion**. This relentless acquisition strategy has driven significant growth in Strategy’s stock, contributing to its inclusion in the **Nasdaq 100 index**.
