short-description: "Islay aficionados, brace yourselves for Laphroaig's
  extraordinary debut – the Wall Collection: Peat. This 36-Year-Old expression
  meticulously highlights the quintessential Laphroaig character – peat."
mk1: "The Wall Collection: Peat is a testament to the craft of finishing,
  utilizing casks previously cradling younger, heavily peated Laphroaig single
  malt to rejuvenate the smoky essence of this venerable whisky."
mk2: >-
  But what truly sets this release apart is its presentation. Each bottle is a
  canvas for London-based artist Laura Carlin's hand-painted artwork, employing
  the very paint that adorns the walls of Laphroaig's legendary Warehouse No. 1.

mk3: "“This Wall Collection is profoundly exciting as it honors two timeless
  pillars of our whisky and our distillery: the rich peat that infuses our
  barley with its profound smokiness and the striking white distillery walls.
  The whisky itself is as exceptional as the bottle. Matured in ex-Bourbon casks
  and then given a finishing touch in a heavily peated cask, it reinvigorates
  the smokiness that sometimes takes a back seat in older whiskies. This bottle
  is a true departure from anything we've unveiled before.\" - Barry MacAffer,
  Distillery Manager for Laphroaig."
