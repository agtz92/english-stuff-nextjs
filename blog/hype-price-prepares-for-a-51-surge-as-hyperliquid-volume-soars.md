  ### Hyperliquid's Dominance Fuels Growth


  **Dominating the perpetual futures trading industry**\

  Hyperliquid has cemented its position as the market leader, with a total processed volume of over $747 billion in futures trades since its inception. Its 24-hour trade volume reached an impressive $12 billion, contributing to a seven-day total of $73 billion. In comparison, Jupiter, the second-largest competitor, only managed $2.61 billion in 24 hours and $11.65 billion in the last week.

  ### Record-breaking Volumes Propel Momentum


  **Unprecedented growth in daily trade volumes**\

  On Monday, Hyperliquid achieved a record daily volume of $22 billion, marking a significant leap from $640 million on the same day last year. This surge is partly attributed to the popularity of newly launched meme coins such as Official Trump and Melania Meme, which achieved multi-billion dollar market caps amidst heightened attention surrounding Donald Trump's inauguration.

  ### HYPE Token's Bullish Breakout


  **Chart patterns signal potential gains**\

  The HYPE token, which peaked at $35.10 in December, has recently formed a falling wedge patternâ€”a key indicator of a bullish breakout. On January 14, the token tested the $24.43 resistance level, executing a break-and-retest pattern that often signals continued upward momentum. Additionally, the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern strengthens the bullish outlook.

  ### Future Price Targets for HYPE


  **Aiming for a 51% surge**\

  If HYPE breaks above the $24.43 resistance, it is poised for a significant bull run. The next key target is $35, its December high, representing a 51% increase from its current levels. This potential surge could further solidify Hyperliquid's dominance and boost investor confidence in the HYPE token.
