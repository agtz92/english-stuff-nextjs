short-description: Making a peaty scotch in Islay is a process that requires
  time and skill. The process begins with the selection of the barley and peat
  used to create the whisky. The barley must be carefully chosen for its flavor
  and texture, while the peat must be harvested from specific areas of Islay to
  ensure it has the right smoky flavor.

  Once the Barley is carefully selected, The process starts with the malting of barley, which is done by soaking the barley in water for several days before allowing it to germinate. 


  </br>During this period, the barley absorbs moisture and begins to convert its starches into sugars. After this, the barley is dried over a peat fire, which gives it its smoky flavor.</br>


  The drying process can take up to 17 hours, during which time the smoke or 'peat reek' rises up through the perforated floor of the kiln and infuses into the malt. 


  </br>This process gives Islay whisky its characteristic smoky flavor. The longer the malt is exposed to peat smoke, the more intense its flavor will be.

  Once the malt has been dried, it is then milled into a coarse powder known as 'grist'. This grist is then mixed with hot water in order to extract sugars from it. The resulting liquid is called 'wort', and this wort is then transferred into fermentation tanks where yeast is added to begin fermentation. 


  </br>During this stage, alcohol and other compounds are produced as byproducts of fermentation.


  </br>After fermentation has finished, the wort is distilled twice in copper stills in order to produce whisky. During distillation, vapors containing alcohol are passed through condensers and collected as liquid whisky at different strengths depending on how long they were distilled for.

  Finally, after distillation has finished, whisky from Islay can be aged for several years in oak barrels before being bottled and sold as single malt Scotch whisky from Islay. The aging process allows for further development of flavors and aromas within the whisky while also mellowing out any harshness that may have been present during distillation.</br>


  During aging, some of the whisky evaporates due to heat and humidity which creates a stronger concentration of flavor compounds known as “angel’s share”.


  </br> The length of time spent aging also affects how much smokey flavor remains in the final product as well as other flavors such as vanilla or caramel notes that develop over time.

  </br>Scotch with peat from Islay can range from light and subtle to intensely smoky depending on how long it was exposed to peat smoke during malting and how long it was aged for afterwards - making each bottle unique!


  </br>Finally, when ready for bottling, each bottle of Scotch whisky must meet certain standards set by law including minimum alcohol content and labeling requirements before it can be sold commercially.
