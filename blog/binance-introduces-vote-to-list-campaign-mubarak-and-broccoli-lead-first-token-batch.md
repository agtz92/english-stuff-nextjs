  deciding which tokens get listed on the platform. Among the most notable

  ### **What Is Binance’s "Vote to List" Initiative?**


  **A new community co-governance model for token listings**


  The “Vote to List” campaign was introduced as part of Binance’s **wider push toward community-driven decision-making** in crypto trading. Under this system, Binance users can **vote on tokens they want to see listed**, with selections ultimately subject to Binance’s internal **due diligence and compliance review**.


  Binance has outlined key criteria for token selection, including:


  * **Project fundamentals** (use case, roadmap, and development progress)

  * **User adoption** (community engagement and active wallets)

  * **Tokenomics** (supply, demand, and distribution model)

  * **Technical risks** (smart contract security and blockchain scalability)

  * **Compliance checks** (regulatory status and team background)


  The first batch of tokens will be drawn **exclusively from the BNB Chain ecosystem**, though Binance has indicated that future voting rounds may include **Binance Alpha and other ecosystems**.

  ### **Which Tokens Are in Binance’s First "Vote to List" Batch?**


  **Nine tokens are competing, with memecoins leading the charge**


  The **inaugural “Vote to List” round** features nine tokens, including several trending **memecoins and niche projects**. These include:


  1. **Mubarak** – A recently hyped memecoin driven by Changpeng Zhao (CZ)-related speculation.

  2. **Broccoli** – Another viral memecoin gaining traction within the BNB Chain ecosystem.

  3. **Banana For Scale** – A project inspired by internet meme culture.

  4. **CreatorBid** – A platform-focused token aimed at the creator economy.

  5. **CZ’s Dog** – A memecoin linked to Binance’s former CEO.

  6. **Koma Inu** – Another Inu-themed dog token riding the memecoin wave.

  7. **SIREN** – A lesser-known DeFi token with speculative interest.

  8. **Tutorial** – A token designed for blockchain education use cases.

  9. **WHY** – A humor-driven project with meme-based marketing.


  While Binance has yet to finalize the **two tokens that will be listed**, traders are already speculating on potential winners. Notably, some of these memecoins have seen **triple-digit gains** in the past 24 hours.


  * **CZ’s Dog surged 104%**, driven by hype surrounding its connection to Binance’s former CEO.

  * **Banana For Scale jumped 27%**, reflecting rising interest in meme-driven projects.

  * **Mubarak, after a massive rally, has corrected by 32%**, signaling increased volatility.


  Despite these short-term gains, analysts warn that **most of these tokens may fade into obscurity**, a common pattern with speculative memecoins.

  ### **Industry Experts Express Concerns Over Memecoin Mania**


  **ARK Invest CEO warns most memecoins could become worthless**


  The rise of **memecoins as a major speculative asset class** has sparked debate among financial experts. In a recent **Bloomberg interview**, **ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood** shared her skepticism, warning that **most internet meme tokens and animal-themed cryptocurrencies will eventually become worthless**.


  According to Wood, only **a handful of memecoins will survive in the long run**, likely those that evolve beyond speculation and establish strong **utility, developer backing, and network effects**.


  This sentiment echoes past market cycles, where **memecoins often experience massive hype before fading out**. While some projects, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, have managed to **sustain long-term relevance**, others have disappeared into obscurity after brief periods of explosive growth.

  ### **What’s Next for Binance’s Token Listing Process?**


  **Expanding "Vote to List" beyond BNB Chain**


  Binance has confirmed that **future rounds of “Vote to List” will expand beyond the BNB Chain**, incorporating projects from **Binance Alpha and other blockchain ecosystems**.


  This could mean greater opportunities for **independent developers and emerging crypto projects** to secure a Binance listing, provided they meet **Binance’s due diligence standards**.


  For traders, this also presents **an opportunity to participate in early-stage token movements**, with potential for **high returns on winning projects**. However, given the speculative nature of memecoins, risk management remains critical.

  ### **Final Thoughts: Is Binance’s “Vote to List” a Game-Changer?**


  The launch of Binance’s “Vote to List” campaign represents a **major shift in how token listings are determined**, giving the **community a more active role** in shaping the exchange’s trading landscape.


  While memecoins like **Mubarak and Broccoli** are attracting headlines, the broader impact of this initiative could extend beyond **short-term hype**, potentially setting a **new standard for decentralized exchange governance**.

For traders, the key takeaway is clear: **participation in Binance’s vote could offer lucrative opportunities**, but caution is needed—especially in highly volatile memecoin markets.
