  **Markets React Within Minutes to Sudden Policy Shift**


  President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of a 90-day pause on new tariffs sent immediate shockwaves through the crypto sector. Ethereum (ETH) surged more than 11% to cross $1,650, while Solana (SOL) exploded 13% higher, jumping past $120.


  The announcement, which temporarily suspended most new tariffs except on Chinese goods, introduced a wave of market-wide optimism. Investors who had braced for extended economic disruption began flooding back into digital assets—causing altcoins and major tokens alike to surge.

  ### Bitcoin Breaks $82K as Shorts Get Wiped Out


  **Massive Liquidations Follow the Sudden Spike**


  Bitcoin also joined the rally, reclaiming $82,000 after dropping below $74,000 just hours earlier. According to CryptoQuant, the rebound triggered more than $92 million in short liquidations within a single hour. Coinglass reported over $574 million in total liquidations in 24 hours, with shorts making up $342 million of that figure.


  This abrupt reversal marks one of the most aggressive turnarounds in months, with retail and institutional traders racing to cover bearish bets. The combination of unexpected policy news and high leverage set the stage for one of the biggest liquidations of the year.

  **Altcoin Market Sees Broad-Based Gains**


  It wasn’t just ETH and SOL riding the wave. Most altcoins recorded significant upward moves as investor sentiment turned bullish. XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) saw large inflows as market participants rotated into risk-on mode.


  The coordinated upswing shows renewed confidence in digital assets as macroeconomic fears momentarily subside. Analysts now expect increased short-term volatility as traders assess how long the rally can last and what Beijing’s response to the China-specific tariffs might be.

  ### U.S. Equities Mirror Crypto Surge


  **Stock Market Sees Largest Single-Day Jump in Years**


  Crypto wasn’t the only sector that benefited from Trump’s announcement. The Nasdaq soared 9%, the S&P 500 rose over 7%, and the Dow Jones gained more than 2,400 points—the biggest single-day jump in five years.


  The correlation between digital assets and tech-heavy equities continues to strengthen, as both sectors react to geopolitical and macroeconomic developments with heightened sensitivity.

  ### Caution Ahead: China Still Faces Heavy Tariffs


  **Beijing’s Next Move Could Disrupt the Rally**


  Despite the widespread rally, not all news was positive. Trump maintained a steep 125% tariff on Chinese imports, escalating tensions with Beijing. Earlier in the week, China had raised its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% in response to Trump’s prior 50% hike.

With China excluded from the tariff pause, analysts warn that any retaliatory measures could reignite volatility. For now, the market rides high—but the next headlines from Beijing could shape whether this recovery turns into a lasting trend or another short-lived spike.
