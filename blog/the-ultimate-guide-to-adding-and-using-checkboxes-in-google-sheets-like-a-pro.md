  ### Cómo agregar una casilla de verificación en Google Sheets


  **Aprende a insertar casillas de verificación básicas en tus hojas de cálculo.**


  Adding a checkbox in Google Sheets is surprisingly simple—but the productivity boost it offers is anything but basic. Whether you're tracking completed tasks, managing approvals, or building interactive dashboards, a checkbox can streamline your workflow instantly.


  To start, open the Google Sheet you want to modify. Highlight the cells where you want to insert checkboxes. Then, from the top menu, click on **Insert**, and choose **Checkbox**. That’s it—you’ll see checkboxes appear in each selected cell. You can check and uncheck them with a click.


  This simple action lets you instantly visualize task progress or decision-making status. It's a satisfying little feature that makes even mundane spreadsheet work feel slightly more rewarding.

  ### Personaliza los valores de tus casillas


  **Haz que tus casillas tengan un significado claro y útil con valores personalizados.**


  By default, Google Sheets assigns TRUE to checked boxes and FALSE to unchecked ones. While this works fine for basic usage, using more descriptive values like “Completed/Not started” or “Approved/Pending” can make your sheet far easier to read and interpret.


  To customize checkbox values:


  1. Click on **Data**, then select **Data validation**.

  2. In the side panel, choose **Checkbox** as the validation type.

  3. Check the box for **Use custom cell values**.

  4. Input your preferred labels for checked and unchecked states (e.g., "YES"/"NO" or "Done"/"To Do").

  5. Click **Done** to apply changes.


  This small tweak can make your spreadsheet far more intuitive, especially when collaborating with others or exporting data to other apps where TRUE/FALSE might not be meaningful.

  ### Crea listas de tareas con tachado automático


  **Usa formato condicional para tachar tareas completadas y mantener el orden.**


  If you're managing a to-do list or project tracker in Google Sheets, conditional formatting can visually signal completed tasks. By applying a strike-through to entire rows when a checkbox is ticked, you give instant visual feedback—and a bit of psychological satisfaction, too.


  Here’s how to do it:


  1. Highlight the entire range where your task list lives.

  2. Go to **Format > Conditional formatting**.

  3. In the side panel, click **Add another rule**.

  4. Under "Format cells if", select **Custom formula is**.

  5. Enter a formula like `=$A2="YES"`, where column A contains the checkboxes.

  6. Choose your formatting style—strike-through, gray fill, etc.

  7. Click **Done**.


  As you check off tasks, the row automatically updates—no extra input needed. It's clean, efficient, and makes project management smoother.

  ### Automatiza con integraciones como Zapier


  **Conecta Google Sheets a otras apps para automatizaciones sin esfuerzo.**


  Google Sheets can do more than you think—especially when paired with tools like Zapier. You can use checkboxes as triggers for automated workflows. For example, when a box is checked, it can send an email, update a CRM, or log activity in another sheet.


  Here are some ready-to-use automations:


  * **Add Gmail emails to Google Sheets** when they meet specific criteria.

  * **Capture Facebook leads** automatically in a Google Sheet.

  * **Send notification emails** whenever a row is updated in your sheet.


  These automations are easy to set up and incredibly useful. They eliminate manual data entry and help you respond in real-time—whether you're dealing with customer leads, internal tasks, or client reports.


  Zapier works with thousands of apps like Slack, Salesforce, and Trello. When paired with Google Sheets, your humble spreadsheet becomes a powerful command center.

  ### Consejos adicionales para usuarios avanzados


  **Lleva tus casillas al siguiente nivel con funciones y fórmulas avanzadas.**


  Want to take things further? Combine checkboxes with spreadsheet formulas to trigger calculations, highlight issues, or segment data dynamically.


  For example:


  * Use `=IF(A2="Done", "✔", "❌")` to visually show completion status.

  * Create dashboards where checkboxes control what data is shown using filter views or QUERY functions.

  * Pair with Google Apps Script for custom workflows that go beyond Zapier's no-code tools.


  These advanced techniques make your spreadsheet interactive and intelligent. From project management to team collaboration, checkboxes can evolve into functional tools that shape how you work with your data.
