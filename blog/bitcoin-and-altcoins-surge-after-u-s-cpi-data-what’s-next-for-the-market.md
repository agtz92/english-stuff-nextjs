  ### CPI Data Fuels Crypto Rally


  **Core inflation cooled, boosting market sentiment.**\

  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a drop in core CPI from 0.3% to 0.2% in December, sparking hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bitcoin soared by 10% to $99,000, lifting altcoins like Virtuals Protocol (+33.22%), ai16z (+26.13%), and Algorand (+21.18%).

  ### Bitcoin’s Technical Momentum


  **BTC breaks key resistance, eyeing $108,000.**\

  Bitcoin surpassed the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement at $94,210 and the 100-day EMA, signaling strong bullish momentum. If this trend holds, BTC could retest its all-time high of $108,000. A drop below $89,000, however, could reverse this outlook.

  **External factors could disrupt the rally.**\

  Despite easing core inflation, headline CPI rose to 2.9%. Ongoing events like Los Angeles wildfires and potential inflationary policies under Trump’s administration could stall progress toward the Fed’s 2% target.
