  The trick to keeping your live Christmas Tree healthy and happy all season
  long is proper watering, fertilizing and light.


  The other key element to successfully planting your live-Christmas tree outdoors is knowing when to do it. Generally speaking, you should wait until at least two weeks after New Year's Day before moving your Live Christmas Tree outside into its new home because that will give it plenty of time to recover from any damage or shock endured while indoors.

  ## Choose the Best Place for Your Replanted Christmas Tree


  <br>The best place for your replanted Christmas tree is going to depend on a few factors. The first factor is going to be the type of soil that your tree is currently planted in. If it is a relatively loose and well-drained soil, then it would be a good idea to pull out as much as you can from around the rootball and replant your tree in a pot with similar soil. 


  <br>This will give your roots more space to grow and make them less likely to rot or dry out during the winter. You should also make sure that the pot has adequate drainage holes at the bottom because this will also help prevent overwatering.<br>


  ## Trees need to acclimate themselves before they can grow.


  <br>Give the plant some time in a cool shelter like an garage or shed that's open on all sides for 7-10 days after bringing them inside from outdoors so they can reenter dormancy again!

  ## Dig the planting hole


  <br>Digging the planting hole should be done with care. It needs to twice as wide than your root ball and you must choose a mild day so that it can grow in properly when its planted on frozen ground or not quite yet thawed out from winter's cold grip which could damage its roots if there are any concerns about how much moisture is available at this time of year since things tend get dry faster once snowfall occurs plus additional stresses such sun exposure may cause problems too depending upon climate zones where one lives<br>


  ## Planting the tree


  Make sure you place the tree into its hole, backfill with soil and tamp gently every layer.<br>


  Also, be sure to remove any burlap from the root ball and all other coverings.

  ## Taking care of your tree


  Taking care of your new tree is easy, but don't fertilize yet!<br>


  Water the roots in deeply and protect it with a screening material such as old pallets or draperies. You can also use potting soil until spring when nutrients will be more fully developed for optimal growth."<br>
