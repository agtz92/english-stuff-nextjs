short-description: Global economic volatility and renewed U.S. protectionism may
  be bad news for traditional markets — but for crypto, it might be the perfect
  storm. According to Binance CEO Richard Teng, a chaotic macro landscape could
  boost long-term demand for Bitcoin and digital assets, even if short-term
  sentiment stays shaky.

  ### Protectionism and Market Stress


  **Teng points to Trump-era tariffs as a trigger for instability**


  Richard Teng’s latest comments follow growing market turmoil caused by policy changes in the U.S., including a new round of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump. These measures, unveiled on “Liberation Day,” are aimed at pressuring key U.S. trade partners by leveraging import levies.


  Teng says this environment is creating “significant volatility across global markets,” with crypto markets feeling the aftershocks as investors brace for uncertain outcomes. When risk levels rise, investors often rotate out of volatile assets — but Teng argues that crypto plays a different role in the bigger picture.

  ### Short-Term Risk, Long-Term Hedge


  **Crypto may benefit from policy turbulence over time**


  While a risk-off approach often leads to selloffs in the short term, Teng believes the same macro forces will eventually drive more people to Bitcoin and other digital assets. His key argument? Crypto, especially decentralized networks like Bitcoin, offers a non-sovereign alternative during times of geopolitical stress.


  “Looking further ahead, this environment could also accelerate interest in crypto as a non-sovereign store of value,” Teng wrote on X.


  Long-term holders continue to see Bitcoin as a hedge — not just against inflation, but against political decisions, trade wars, and central bank unpredictability.

  ### Tariffs and Tensions


  **Trump’s economic policies could reshape the crypto narrative**


  Trump’s new tariffs have introduced uncertainty at a global scale. His administration's approach echoes previous strategies: applying pressure through import levies to gain leverage in international negotiations. While these moves aim to benefit the U.S. economy, they often cause ripple effects across markets.


  Investors may increasingly turn to crypto for stability when fiat currencies and equities become difficult to trust or predict. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature offers protection from central authority shifts, currency manipulation, and trade-related shocks.


  Crypto’s volatility may be high, but its independence from state-driven economic tools is what gives it long-term potential in uncertain times.

  ### Why the Market’s Shaky Start Might Not Matter


  **Teng’s thesis aligns with broader crypto industry sentiment**


  Despite the market’s mixed performance in early April, Teng’s view reflects a growing consensus in the digital asset community: macro chaos is not a bug, but a feature. It challenges the foundations of fiat-based systems and opens the door to alternatives like decentralized finance and borderless value stores.


  As regulation, tariffs, and fiscal experiments reshape the financial landscape, crypto continues to present itself as a parallel system — imperfect, but fundamentally different.
