short-description: Bitdeer Technologies Group has reported a massive $531.9
  million net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024, a stark contrast to the $5
  million loss in Q4 2023. The company’s total revenue for the period also saw a
  significant decline, dropping from $114.8 million in Q4 2023 to $69 million in
  Q4 2024.

  The downturn is attributed to **heavy investments** in developing **proprietary application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technology**, which **temporarily slowed** Bitdeer’s hashrate expansion. Despite these financial setbacks, the company still holds **$476.3 million in cash and cash equivalents** as of **December 31, 2024**.

  ### **Bitdeer’s Path to 40 EH/s Hashrate**


  In **2025**, Bitdeer plans to **activate its SEALMINER A1s** and deploy **28 exahashes per second (EH/s) of SEALMINER A2s**, aiming for a total **self-mining hashrate of approximately 40 EH/s** by **Q4 2025**. This strategy is part of the company’s efforts to **vertically integrate** and enhance its position in the **blockchain and high-performance computing** industries.


  The planned hashrate expansion is seen as **a long-term investment** that could **boost Bitdeer’s competitiveness** in the rapidly evolving crypto mining sector.


  However, the company’s **stock price (BTDR) has taken a hit**, trading at **$9.10**, marking a **30% decline on the day**. This drop reflects investor concerns over **widening losses** and **uncertainties** in the mining industry.

  ### **Bitcoin Mining Industry Faces New Challenges**


  Bitdeer’s struggles are not isolated—many **bitcoin miners** are facing **similar financial pressures**, particularly after the **April 2024 Bitcoin halving event**, which reduced the daily mining rewards from **900 BTC to 450 BTC**.


  This has led to a surge in the **cost of mining**:


  * The **average cost** to produce **one bitcoin** for U.S.-listed miners climbed to **$55,950** in **Q3 2024**.

  * Factoring in **depreciation and stock-based compensation**, some estimates push this figure to **$106,000 per BTC**.


  As mining profits decline, companies are **seeking alternative revenue streams**. Some firms, including **Crusoe Energy**, have started **pivoting toward artificial intelligence (AI) data center leasing**, a trend that **Bitdeer is also exploring**.

  ### **AI and Energy Growth: Bitdeer’s Recovery Plan**


  Despite the **record loss**, Bitdeer remains focused on **long-term growth**. The company’s **2.6-gigawatt power expansion** and **plans to build AI data centers** could help drive a **financial turnaround**. By diversifying into **AI infrastructure**, Bitdeer aims to **offset declining bitcoin mining profits** and capitalize on the **growing demand for high-performance computing power**.


  This strategy could prove crucial as **traditional bitcoin mining faces increasing regulatory scrutiny, energy costs, and profitability challenges**.

  ### **Crypto Market Outlook and Analyst Insights**


  While **mining difficulties are mounting**, some analysts remain **bullish** on the sector.


  Notably, **H.C. Wainwright analysts** recently stated that **Q4 2024** was a **strong quarter** for bitcoin miners. The cryptocurrency surpassed **$100,000 for the first time**, driven by:


  * **Increased institutional adoption**

  * **Pro-crypto policies under President Donald Trump’s administration**

These factors suggest that, despite short-term **financial setbacks**, Bitdeer and the broader **bitcoin mining industry** could see **stronger performance** as market conditions **stabilize** in **2025**.
