  tool called AltTab brings true Alt + Tab functionality to macOS, letting you
  seamlessly flip through all open windows—just like on Windows. At
  3minread.com, we simplify tech upgrades that help you work faster and smarter.
  Here's how to set it up and supercharge your Mac workflow.

  ### Why the Default Mac Window Switching Falls Short


  **macOS hides individual windows behind application-level switching.**


  Mac users are often surprised to learn that Command + Tab, the default shortcut for switching tasks, only toggles between applications—not individual windows. This can be frustrating when, say, you have multiple Google Docs or Chrome tabs open in separate windows and want to toggle between them quickly.


  Want to switch between two separate Safari windows? Command + Tab won’t help. For that, you need Command + ` (backtick), which only works within a single app. And even then, it doesn’t give you an overview of your open windows—no thumbnails, no layout, just blind cycling.


  This fragmented experience is especially painful for former Windows users, where Alt + Tab shows all open windows with previews, allowing for visual multitasking and faster workflow decisions. Luckily, there's an elegant workaround: an app called **AltTab** that mimics Windows behavior on macOS.

  **AltTab is a free, open-source utility that restores full-window control.**


  AltTab is a lightweight application that bridges the productivity gap by introducing a true Alt + Tab functionality to your Mac. It allows you to see **previews of every open window**—regardless of which app they're from—and switch between them using a single, intuitive shortcut: Option + Tab.


  To install AltTab:


  1. Download it from [AltTab's official site](<>).

  2. Move it into your Applications folder.

  3. Grant the required permissions:

     * **Accessibility Access** (so it can manage your windows)
     * **Screen Recording Access** (to generate window previews)

  Once launched, AltTab immediately activates the Option + Tab shortcut. Press and hold Option, then press Tab to cycle through previews of all your currently open windows. Let go when your desired window is highlighted, and boom—you’re there.


  It’s fast, smooth, and genuinely makes window management feel effortless. Bonus? You can use arrow keys to navigate, press **W** to close windows, **M** to minimize, or **H** to hide—right from the switcher.

  ### Tailor AltTab to Fit Your Workflow


  **Customize keyboard shortcuts, window filtering, and visual layouts.**


  AltTab isn’t just a copycat—it’s highly customizable. Once installed, click the AltTab icon in your menu bar and open Preferences to dive into the settings.


  Here’s what you can adjust:


  * **Controls tab**: Define up to three custom shortcut combinations. For example, use Control + Tab instead of Option + Tab if that feels more natural. You can even set rules like “only show windows from the current desktop space.”

  * **Appearance tab**: Modify the switcher’s layout—adjust thumbnail size, number of rows, spacing, and more. You can even hide apps without open windows to reduce clutter.

  * **Behavior tab**: Choose whether hidden or minimized windows should be included in the switcher. Disable apps you never want to see in the AltTab overlay. For example, maybe you don’t need to cycle through background apps like your clipboard manager.


  The customization is deep enough that you can mold AltTab to reflect exactly how you think and work. Whether you prefer simplicity or complexity, it adapts to you.

  ### Common Questions About Window Switching on Mac


  **Not sure how macOS handles multitasking? Here are the answers.**


  **Q: What’s the Alt key on Mac?**\

  The Mac equivalent of Alt is the **Option (⌥)** key, located between Control (⌃) and Command (⌘). However, it doesn’t behave exactly like Alt on Windows by default—hence why AltTab is needed.


  **Q: How do I switch between all open windows on Mac?**\

  Without AltTab, you can only cycle through apps using Command + Tab, or windows within a single app using Command + `. To view all windows at once, use Control + Up Arrow to open Mission Control.


  **Q: Can I switch tabs in a browser using shortcuts?**\

  Yes! Use Command + Option + Left/Right Arrow to switch between tabs in browsers or tab-friendly apps like Notion or Finder.


  **Q: How do I close, minimize, or hide windows using AltTab?**\

  While holding Option and using AltTab:


  * Press **W** to close a window

  * Press **M** to minimize

  * Press **H** to hide


  This lets you perform quick actions without lifting your fingers from the keyboard.

  ### Transform Your Workflow with One Small App


  **Get the multitasking control you've always wanted on Mac.**


  AltTab fills one of macOS's most frustrating gaps. Instead of shuffling between apps or constantly reaching for the mouse, you get a slick, keyboard-first interface that shows you **everything that’s open**, not just which app is on top.


  At 3minread.com, we love tools that amplify productivity without overwhelming complexity. AltTab fits that mold perfectly—it takes just minutes to set up, yet saves you hours of clicking, searching, and alt-tabbing (pun intended) through clutter.
